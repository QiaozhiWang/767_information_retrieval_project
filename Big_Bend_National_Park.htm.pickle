center[5]geology[edit]big bend from space, 2002aerial view, 3d computer generated imagethe oldest recorded tectonic activity in the park is related to the paleozoic marathon orogeny, although proterozoic events (over 550 mya) possibly have some deep control. the marathon orogeny (part of the ouachita-marathon-sonora orogenic belt) is part of thrusting of rocks from the south american plate over the north american plate. this can be best seen in the persimmon gap area of the park. this orogenic event is linked to the lack of triassic- and jurassic-age rocks in the park.[3]between the triassic and the cretaceous, the south american plate rifted from the north american plate, resulting in the deposition of the glen rose limestone, del carmen limestone, sue peaks formation, santa elena limestone, del rio clay, buda limestone, and boquillasgulf of mexico opened, which resulted in east-west striking normal faulting.[3] as a result of this depositional time, dinosaur,[6] forest[7][8] and other fossils are preserved in the park.following the ending of rifting in the late cretaceous to the early cenozoic, the big bend area was subjected to the laramide orogeny. this period of (now east-west) compression caused the northeast-facing mesa de anguila (an uplifted monoclinethrust-faulted monocline that forms the boundary of the park on the east) and the tornillo basin. during the middle cenozoic, most of the volcanic rocks, including the chisos group, the pine canyon caldera complex, and the burro mesa formation, formed.[3]the most recent tectonic activity in the park is basin and range faulting from the neogene to quaternary. this period of east-west extension has resulted in estufa and dehalo bolsons in the chisos mountains, as well as the terlingua and sierra del carmen, chalk draw, and burro mesa faults. the rio grande has entered the big bend area roughly 2 mya, and since then, extensive erosion and downcutting have occurred.[3]cultural resources[edit]cultural resources in the park range from the paleo-indian period 10,500 years ago through the historic period represented by native american groups, such as the chisos, mescaleros, and comanche. more recently, spanish, mexican, anglo, and irish settlers farmed, ranched, and mined in the area.throughout the prehistoric period, humans found shelter and maintained open campsites throughout the park. the archeological record reveals an archaic-period desert culture, whose inhabitants developed a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged for several thousand years.the historic cultural landscape centers upon various subsistence or commercial land uses. the riparian and tributary environments were used for subsistence and irrigation farming. transportation networks, irrigation structures, simple domestic residences and outbuildings, and planed and terraced farm land lining the stream banks characterize these landscapes.human history[edit]pine canyon falls inside big bend national parkduring the early historic period (before 1535) several indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the big bend. the chisos indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. the origin of the chisos indians is not known. linguistically, they were associated with the conchos indians of northern chihuahua and northwestern coahuila. their language group spoke a variation of uto-aztecan, a language whose speakers ranged from central mexico to the great basin of the u.s.the jumano was a nomadic group that traveled and traded throughout west texas and southeastern new mexico, but some historic records indicate they were enemies of the chisos. around the beginning of the 18th century, the mescalero apaches began to invade the big bend region and displaced the chisos indians. one of the last native american groups to use the big bend was the comanches, who passed through the park along the comanche trail on their way to and from periodic raids into the mexican interior. these raids continued until the mid-19th century. the last of the great military leaders of the native peoples of the region was an apache of spanish ancestry named alzate, who was active as late as the late 1860s.the european presence in the region begins circa 1535 ad with the first spanish explorations into this portion of north america. the expedition of  passed near the big bend and was followed by other expeditions. some of these expeditions were searching for gold and silver, or farm and ranch land. others, such as those by the franciscan missionaries, were intended to establish centers in which the natives could be evangelized. in an attempt to protect the northern frontier of the new spain, from which emerged present-day mexico, a line of presidios, or forts, was established along the rio grande in the late 18th century. the presidio de san vicente was built near present-day san vicente, coahuila, and the presidio de san carlos was built near present-day manuel benavides, chihuahua. some of the presidios were soon abandoned, because of financial difficulties and because they could not effectively stop indian intrusions into mexico. the soldiers and settlers of these presidios moved to newer presidios where the interests of the spanish empire were more defensible. such was the case of santa rosa maria del sacramento, now muzquiz, coahuila.very little study has been made of the spanish occupation of the big bend following the abandonment of the presidios. in 1805, a spanish settlement called altares existed 30mi (48km) south of the rio grande. the region became a part of mexico when it achieved its independence from spain in 1821. mexican families lived in the area when english-speaking settlers began arriving following the secession of texas during the latter half of the 19th century.following the end of the mexican-american war in 1848, the u.s. army made military surveys of the uncharted land of the big bend. forts and outposts were established across trans-pecos texas to protect migrating settlers from indian attacks. a significant proportion of the soldiers in the late 1800s were african american and came to be called the "buffalo soldiers", a name apparently given to them by the native americans. lieutenant henry flipper, the first american of african ancestry to graduate from west point, served in shafter, texas, near the end of the 19th century. (shafter, named for him, lies west of the big bend along the highway from presidio to marfa.) ranchers began to settle in the big bend about 1880, and by 1900, sheep, goat, and cattle ranches occupied most of the area. the delicate desert environment was soon overgrazed.in the late 19th and early 20th century, valuable mineral deposits were discovered and brought settlers who worked in the mines or supported the mines by farming or by cutting timber for the mines and smelters. communities sprang up around the mines. boquillas and terlingua all resulted from mining operations. during this period, the rio grande flood plain was settled by farmers. settlements developed with names like terlingua abajo, san vicente, la coyota, and castolon. often, no more than clusters of families were living and farming in the same area, and they were successful only to the degree that the land was able to support them.in the 1930s, many people who loved the big bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. in 1933, the texas legislature passed legislation to establish texas canyons state park. later that year, the park was redesignated big bend state park. in 1935, the united states congress passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. the state of texas deeded the land that it had acquired to the federal government, and on june 12, 1944, big bend national park became a reality. the park opened to visitors on july 1, 1944.flora and fauna[edit]a javelina in big bendbluebonnets in big benddespite its harsh desert environment, big bend has more than 1200 species of plants (including 60 cactus species), over 600 species of vertebrates, and about 3600 insect species. the variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry, hot desert, the cool mountains, and the fertile river valley.most of the animals are not visible in the day, particularly in the desert. the park comes alive at night, with many of the animals foraging for food. about 150 cougar (puma concolor) sightings are reported per year, despite the fact that only two dozen cougars live in the park.[9] other species that inhabit the park include black-tailed jackrabbit (lepus californicus), kangaroo rat (dipodomys spp.), greater roadrunner (geococcyx californianus), golden eagle (aquila chrysaetos), collared peccary (pecari tajacu), and coyote (canis latrans). mexican black bears (ursus americanus eremicus) are also present in the mountain areas.the variety of cactus and other plant life add color to the big bend region. cactus species in the park include prickly pear (opuntia spp.), claretcup (echinocereus coccineus), and pitaya (e. enneacanthus). in the spring, the wildflowers are in full bloom and the yucca flowers display bright colors. bluebonnets (lupinus spp.) are prevalent in big bend, and white and pink bluebonnets are sometimes visible by the road. other flowering plants such as the desert marigold (baileya multiradiata), desert willow (chilopsis linearis), ocotillo (fouquieria splendens), rock nettle (eucnide urens), and lechuguilla (agave lechuguilla) abound in big bend.the first u.s. record of the northern tufted flycatcher (mitrephanes phaeocercus), a central american species, was from this site in november 1991. birders also flock to the park, as it is home to the only area in the united states within the breeding range of the colima warbler (vermivora crissalis).plans to reintroduce the mexican wolf to big bend national park were rejected in the late 1980s by the state of texas. disagreement over the reintroduction included the question of whether the park contained enough prey animals, such as deer and javelinas, to sustain a wolf population.[10]tourist information[edit]big bend is one of the largest, most remote, and least-visited national parks in the lower 48 united states.[11]big bend's primary attraction is its hiking and backpacking trails. particularly notable among these are the chimneys trail, which visits a rock formation in the desert; the marufo vega trail, a loop trail that passes through scenic canyons on the way to and from the rio grande; the south rim trail which circles the high mountains of the chisos; and the outer mountain loop trail in the chisos, which incorporates parts of the south rim loop, descends into the desert along the dodson trail, and then returns to the chisos basin, completing a 30-mile loop. other notable locations include santa elena canyon, grapevine hills, and the mule ears, two imposing rock towers in the middle of the desert. professional backpacking guide services provide trips in the park.the park administers 118 miles (190km) of the rio grande for recreational use. professional river outfitters provide tours of the river. use of a personal boat is permitted, but a free river float permit is required. in june 2009, the department of homeland security began treating all float trips as trips that had left the country and required participants to have an acceptable form of identification such as a passport to re-enter the country.[12]visitors often crossed the rio grande to visit the mexican village of boquillas, but the department of homeland security closed the border crossing in 2002. in april 2013, the boquillas crossing reopened as an official class b port of entry between the u.s. and mexico. it is open wednesday through sunday between 9 am and 6 pm.[13][14][15]with more than 450 species of birds recorded in the park, a widely popular activity is birdwatching. many species stop in the park during their annual migrations.five paved roads are in big bend. persimmon gap to panther junction is a 28-mile (45km) road from the north entrance of the park to park headquarters at panther junction. panther junction to rio grande village is a 21-mile (34km) road that descends 2,000 feet (610m) from the park headquarters to the rio grande. maverick entrance station to panther junction is a 23-mile (37km) route from the western entrance of the park to the park headquarters. chisos basin road is 6 miles (10km) long and climbs to 5,679 feet (1,731m) above sea level at panther pass before descending into the chisos basin. the 30-mile (48km) ross maxwell scenic drive leads to the castolon historic district and santa elena canyon.for out of state visitors who wish to visit big bend, flying into midland/odessa and then renting a car is the best option available. as a side note, it is a good idea for tourists to purchase tents, gear, and food/snacks in one of the large cities near the airport, as the small towns around big bend are not equipped with everything a camper will need. however, a well-stocked grocery is open in the town of study butte near the western entrance to the park.gallery[edit]balanced rock in big bendsanta elena canyonpink lupine mingling with bluebonnetsemory peak's summit, the highest point in big bend national parkocotillolooking at the sunset behind the hills from boquillas canyoncasa grande (spanish for "big house"), an iconic rock formationcanyon walls viewed from the window hiking traillizard blending in with a rock formationwhite-tailed deer near a hiking trailsee also[edit]government of the united states portaltexas portalbig bendbig bend ranch state parkchihuahuan desertchisos mountainsguadalupe mountainslist of areas in the national park system of the united statesmarathon, texasmckittrick canyonpecos riverrio grande wild and scenic riverterlingua, texastrans-pecoswest texasreferences[edit]^ a b "listing of acreage as of december 31, 2011". land resource division, national park service. retrieved 2012-03-05.^ "nps annual recreation visits report". national park service. retrieved 2015-06-16.^ a b c d e f gray, j.e.;
