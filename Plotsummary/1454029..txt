skeeter to her friends and family - has just graduated from ole miss and has returned home in part to take care of her seriously ill mother. unlike her female friends and colleagues who used their ole miss time solely to find a husband, skeeter, who has never dated or had a boyfriend despite wanting romance in her life, strives primarily for a career, either as a serious journalist or editorialist. in skeeter's social circle, the family servants, called "the help", are exclusively black. the female servants do the cooking and cleaning, but their primary responsibility is child rearing. the servants get passed down within families from generation to generation, so the child that they raised ultimately becomes the boss. fifty year old aibileen clark is one such servant, who works for skeeter's easily influenced friend, elizabeth leefolt. skeeter asks aibileen to help her with her newly acquired job, answering a housekeeping advice column. however, incidents that happen around skeeter, including her mother seemingly being less than forthright about what happened to their own now absent female servant, the elderly constantine jefferson, who raised skeeter and who skeeter loved like a mother, make skeeter come to the decision to write about the experiences of the black female servants in relation to their white bosses. elaine stein, a senior editor with harper  row in new york, approves the concept, but she knows that skeeter getting the servants to talk, which skeeter ultimately discovers is against the law in mississippi, will be difficult if not impossible. aibileen, the first and only servant who skeeter asks, initially refuses skeeter's request. but incidents around aibileen ultimately get her and her acerbic-tongued best friend, minny jackson, who has long worked for the walters family and now works for the walters' racist daughter hilly holbrook, to talk to skeeter on the sly about their experiences. one of those incidents involves hilly's "home help sanitation initiative", which would ban any black servant from using their white employer's washroom. minny's experiences also include those with celia foote, a young uncultured woman new to the area who has never had servants, who is now married to hilly's old boyfriend johnny foote, and who is shunned by hilly and her social circle for supposedly cheating with johnny while he and she were still dating. even if harper  row or any other firm publishes the book, skeeter and by association any servant who helped her may have a continued rough road ahead in overcoming the resulting wrath, especially by hilly and her type.        written by  huggo an aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the african-american maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.     written by  moviedude346 synopsis in civil-rights era jackson, mississippi, 23-year-old eugenia "skeeter" phelan ( ), a recent graduate of the university of mississippi and an aspiring writer...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the help storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users oscar challange 2012  created 27 jan 2012      film / television  created 02 feb 2012      maria  created 14 jun 2012      my favorite movies  created 23 jul 2013      dreamworks pictures  created 06 nov 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
