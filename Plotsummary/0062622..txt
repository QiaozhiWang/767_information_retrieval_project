technology is treated as irrelevant to the quest--literally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature hal entity. story told as a montage of impressions, music, and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. a very influential film and still a class act, even after 25 years.        written by  robin kenny  robink@hparc0.aus.hp.com when a large black monolith is found beneath the surface of the moon, the reaction immediately is that it was intentionally buried. when the point of origin is confirmed as jupiter, an expedition is sent in hopes of finding the source. when dr. david bowman discovers faults in the expeditionary spacecraft's communications system, he discovers more than he ever wanted to know.        written by  alexander o'neill the monoliths have been watching us. they gave humankind the evolutionary kick in the pants it needed to survive at the dawn of time. in 1999, humankind discovered a second monolith on the moon. now, in the year 2001, the s.s. discovery and its crew, captains dave bowman and frank poole, and their onboard computer, hal 9000, must discover what alien force is watching earth....        written by  tones  tones120c@aol.com humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial object buried beneath the lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer h.a.l. 9000, sets off on a quest.     written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com synopsis to ' tone poem "thus spake zarathustra," the title sequence shows the sun rising behind the earth...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page 2001: a space odyssey storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
