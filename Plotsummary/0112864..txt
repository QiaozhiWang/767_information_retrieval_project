bomb explodes in the bonwit teller department store, causing several vehicles to flip, and causing several drivers to come to a sudden stop. this throws the nypd into a frenzy, trying to sort out what's going on. at the station, inspector walter cobb of the nypd's major case unit gets a call from a man who calls himself simon. simon asks for lieutenant john mcclane, and walter tells simon that john, who is now an alcoholic, is on suspension. simon wants john to go to the corner of 138th street and amsterdam in harlem and wear a racist sign. walter and his fellow officers joe lambert, connie

one of simon's bombs from blowing up a subway station, and it turns out that simon is simon peter gruber the brother of hans gruber, the terrorist that john rescued the nakatomi building from in los
