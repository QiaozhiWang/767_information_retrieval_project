and by whom? it is up to two of those ex-crime fighters to investigate the plot that seems to go beyond the unthinkable.        written by  ruckwood in an alternate 1985 where former superheroes exist, the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante rorschach into his own sprawling investigation, uncovering something that could completely change the course of history as we know it.     written by  jokerboy1991 synopsis see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page watchmen storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
