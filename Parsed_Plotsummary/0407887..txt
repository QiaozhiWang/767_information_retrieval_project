police academy follow opposite sides of the law: billy costigan is assigned to work undercover with the irish mobster frank costello to get evidence to arrest him. his true identity is known only by his superiors dignam and oliver queenan. the protg of costello, colin sullivan, is promoted in the massachusetts state police and is the informer of costello. each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other "rat."        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil crime boss francis "frank" costello leads and raises young colin sullivan (matt damon) to be a mole in the massachusetts state police. meanwhile, his eventual rival billy costigan (dicaprio) is recruited by staff sergeant dignam (mark wahlberg) and captain queenan (martin sheen) to go undercover to infiltrate the mob. in this epic, explosive, mystifying movie, the two search after each other as they are both involved affairs of the opposite organization. playing the cat-and-mouse game constantly through the film, in the end, sullivan connects to costigan who refuses to cancel his mission. sullivan additionally learns of costello's role as informer for the fbi, causing him to care about his identity. later on, costigan finds an envelope from costello revealing sullivan's plan as a mole. madolyn (farmiga), sullivan's girlfriend, hears the plans from the envelope and finds sullivan is working as a mole for the mob. on a roof, costigan finds sullivan sorry and with hesitation, and identifies him as the mole, arresting him, but when he takes him down the elevator, he is shot by trooper barrigan, who is also working as a source for the mob, who is then shot later by sullivan, who identifies barrigan rather as the mole. in this suspenseful, deceitful, conniving thriller, sullivan is finally identified as the mole who pervaded the fbi.        written by  clifton baird years ago, a powerful irish mafia figure placed a small selection of his youngest, brightest
