"king" kong, one of the b-52 bomber pilots, is working on his own agenda of deploying his bomb where ever he can on enemy soil if he can't make it to his intended target.        written by  huggo u.s. air force general jack ripper goes completely and utterly mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the u.s.s.r. he suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the "precious bodily fluids" of the american people. the u.s. president meets with his advisors, where the soviet ambassador tells him that if the u.s.s.r. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a "doomsday machine" which will destroy all plant and animal life on earth. peter sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: british group captain lionel mandrake, the only person with access to the demented gen. ripper; u.s. president merkin muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken soviet premier and the former nazi genius dr. strangelove, who concludes that "such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious". will the bombers be stopped in time, or will general jack ripper succeed in destroying the world ?        written by  colin tinto  cst@imdb.com u.s. president merkin muffley is on the hot line to moscow with some rather embarrassing news for the soviet premier: "hello, dimitri....i'm fine....now then, you know how we've always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the bomb....the bomb, dimitri. the hydrogen bomb....well, now, what happened is that, uh, one of our base commanders...he went a little funny in the head....and he went and did a silly thing....he ordered his planes to attack your country." a comedy about an accidental nuclear attack? one that ends with total annihilation, thermonuclear apocalypse? preposterous! stanley kubrick thought otherwise. in the end his thinking prevailed. the mad saga revolves around a psychotic strategic air command officer, gen. jack d. ripper, who lets loose his b-52 bomber squadron on the soviet union. ripper takes this unilateral action because of his paranoid belief that communists are sapping and contaminating "all our precious bodily fluids" as part of their plan to take over the world. unbeknownst to ripper, his attack will trigger the russian's ultimate weapon, the doomsday machine, a diabolical retaliatory device set to blow up the planet.        written by  alfiehitchie an insane general triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.     written by  anonymous synopsis at the burpelson u.s. air force base somewhere in the continental usa, the eccentric brigadier general jack d...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users my favourite movies  created 21 sep 2011      mccloud's top 30 favorite movies  created 22 apr 2012      movies worth watching  created 23 aug 2013      darkest comedies  created 02 jan 2014      download to see  created 07 feb 2015      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
