off the coast of sweden to celebrate david's return from the swiss alps, where he was substantially completing his latest novel. the family has long lived a fantasy of they being a loving one, david's extended absences which are the cause of many of the family's problems. without that parental guidance, minus is at a confused and vulnerable stage of his life where he is a bundle of repressed emotions, most specifically concerning not feeling loved by his father and concerning the opposite sex. he is attracted to females as a collective but does not know how to handle blatant female sexuality, especially if it is directed his way. a month earlier karin was released from a mental institution. her doctor has told martin that the likelihood that she will fully recover from her illness is low, her ultimate fate being that her mental state will disintegrate totally, although she has functioned well since her release. in his love for her, martin has vowed to himself to see her
