with lionel even calling him "bertie" instead of "your royal highness" in their sessions, which doesn't sit well with albert, not used to such familiarity with a commoner. lionel does in time become bertie's confidante and friend, especially from lionel's side as he tries to determine the psychological issues behind the speech impediment. an issue with lionel (which he does not hide but also does not fully disclose) may threaten their relationship altogether, which may be especially problematic as a still stammering bertie ultimately becomes  king george vi and britain enters into war with germany.        written by  huggo / edited by statmanjeff in 1925, the duke of york is stammerer and has troubles to speak to the public. his wife elizabeth seeks the treatment of the speech therapist lionel logue that follows unconventional methods and relationship, and bertie gives up the treatment on the first day. however, after listening to the session that was recorded by lionel, the bertie returns to the treatment. in the mid 30's, the duke of york is forced to assume the throne of england as king george vi due to the abdication of his older brother king edward viii. immediately after, there is a crisis in the government and england declares war to germany. king george vi needs to make a speech to his compatriots, and his friend lionel helps him using an unorthodox technique.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil the story of king george vi of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, his impromptu ascension to the throne and the speech therapist who helped the unsure monarch become worthy of it.     written by  kenneth chisholm synopsis the film opens with prince albert, duke of york (later king george vi), known to his wife and family as "bertie" ( )...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the king's speech storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users watched  created 11 feb 2012      my favourite movies all time  created 05 jun 2012      my favorites shows  created 08 dec 2014      wish  created 13 mar 2015      british movies  created 1 month ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
