presumed killed in world war ii. on v.e. day, nora gives birth to their son, who she names tommy. while tommy is an adolescent, nora marries frank, a shifty camp counselor. shortly thereafter, tommy suffers an emotionally traumatic experience associated with his father and step-father, which, based on things told to him at that time, results in him becoming deaf, dumb and blind, a situation which several people exploit for their own pleasure. as nora tries several things to bring tommy out of his psychosomatic disabilities, tommy, now a young man, happens upon pinball as a stimulus. playing by intuition, tommy becomes a pinball master, which in turn makes him, and by association nora and frank, rich and famous. nora literally shatters tommy to his awakening, which ultimately leads to both the family's rise and downfall as people initially try to emulate tommy's path then rebel against it.        written by  huggo tommy is blind, deaf and dumb, but there is nothing wrong with him. as a small child, he accidentally witnessed the murder of his father by his stepfather. his mother and stepfather told him to forget everything he had seen and heard, and to never talk about it; but tommy carried it to the extreme, turned inward, and stopped seeing, hearing or speaking at all. he suffered much while growing up, and finally found happiness in, of all things, playing pinball. when he became the world champion pinball player it brought his family fame and fortune. after being spontaneously healed, he began to teach others of his unique perspective on life, eventually becoming a religious cult figure.        written by  zbirdman cpt. walker's plane is shot down during world war 2 and he is presumed dead. nora walker meets frank hobbs while her son, tommy is attending "bernies

and frank tell tommy that he didn't see it, hear it, and to never speak of it. this causes him to go deaf, dumb and blind. they try a few cures, such as a preacher that believes marilyn monroe can heal, and a woman named gypsie "the acid queen". they then give up, and to get out of the house they leave tommy with the relatives. first up, cousin kevin who tortures him. then uncle ernie, who rapes him. then they decide to leave him by the mirror, which he curiously stares into almost all day. he sees himself beckoning him, and tommy follows, straight to a junkyard where he finds a device that will change his life, a pinball machine. he becomes the world's greatest player, which makes his family rich. they go to see a doctor, that tells them they need to find some kind of shock to
