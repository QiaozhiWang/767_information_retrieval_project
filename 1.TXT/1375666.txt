inception. instead of the perfect heist, cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. if they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. but no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. an enemy that only cobb could have seen coming.        written by  warner bros. pictures dominic cobb is an industrial spy who instead of breaking into a person's home, office, or even computer, gets the information he needs by getting into the person's mind through their dreams. cobb is also a fugitive who misses his children. someone approaches cobb and wants to hire him but instead of getting information out, the man wants cobb to implant something, a process called 'inception', which is not easy to do. cobb is hesitant to do it but when the man offers to help cobb go back to his children, cobb agrees. so he assembles his team but when they begin, there are things cobb didn't tell his team that could jeopardize the job and when they occur they're not sure if they should continue.        written by  rcs0411@yahoo.com dominic cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction - inserting oneself into a subject's dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing - a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, dr. stephen miles. dom's associates are miles' former students, who dom requires as he himself has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won't disclose. dom's primary associate, arthur, believes it has something to do with dom's deceased wife, mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or dom's want to "go home" i.e. get back to his own reality, which includes two young children. dom's work is generally in corporate espionage. as the subjects don't want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. dom is also a wanted man as many of his past subjects have learned what dom has done to them. one of those subjects, mr. saito, offers dom a job he can't refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject's dreams without them knowing. inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. saito's target is robert michael fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning fischer himself, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and cobb's newest associate ariadne's belief that cobb's own subconscious, especially as it relates to mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams.        written by  huggo corporate espionage. cobb can invade people's dreams, so corporations hire him to steal business secrets from rivals' subconscious. saito, an energy magnate, wants cobb to do the reverse: not take information, but plant an idea in a rival's mind. in return, he'll fix problems with the us government so cobb can return to his children. cobb takes the near-impossible job, planning three layers of dreams within dreams for the mark. it requires a larger team taking a powerful sedative: if something goes awry, the dreamers may not awake. cobb doesn't tell his team that his past nurtures feelings powerful enough to bring on this comatose state for all of them. and the children - are they real?        written by  jhailey@hotmail.com dom cobb is able to use his unique skills to his advantage - he can enter people's minds through their dreams and thereby learn their secrets. he is a thief for hire but japanese businessman mr. saito has a somewhat different proposition for him. he wants cobb to enter the mind of robert fischer jr., who is about to inherit his father's massive business empire, to plant a simple notion: to break-up his father's conglomerate and sell it off. in return, saito will make it possible for cobb to freely return to the us where he is currently wanted by the police. cobb accepts and assembles his team with a plan to plant the idea deep in fisher's mind by generating a series of dreams within dreams so that he eventually thinks he came up with the idea himself. as the intended deception grows ever more complex, cobb has to deal with his own emotions and feelings of guilt, which are projecting themselves into the dreamspace. cobb has to deal with the eventual question of what is real and what is only a dream.        written by  garykmcd a thief, who steals corporate secrets through use of dream-sharing technology, is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a ceo.     written by  skip_4591 synopsis a young man, exhausted and delirious, washes up on a beach, looking up momentarily to see two young children ( and ) playing in the sand before he passes out...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page inception storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users 25 great movies (no order)  created 04 jul 2011      the great ones  created 02 dec 2011      already seen  created 02 feb 2012      sci-fi  created 13 jan 2013      mt best  created 15 jul 2013      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
