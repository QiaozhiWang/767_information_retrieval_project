summary showing all 5 plot summaries when a mutual friend is killed by a mob boss, two con men, one experienced and one young try to get even by pulling off the big con on the mob boss. the story unfolds with several twists and last minute alterations.        written by  john vogel  jlvogel@comcast.net johnny hooker, a small time grifter, unknowingly steals from doyle lonnegan, a big time crime boss, when he pulls a standard street con. lonnegan demands satisfaction for the insult. after his partner, luther, is killed, hooker flees, and seeks the help of henry gondorff, one of luther's contacts, who is a master of the long con. hooker wants to use gondorff's expertise to take lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even the score, since he admits he "doesn't know enough about killing to kill him." they devise a complicated scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations. the stakes are high in this game, and our heroes must not only deal with lonnegan's murderous tendencies, but also other side players who want a piece of the action. to win, hooker and gondorff will need all their skills...and a fair amount of confidence.        written by  headlessannie johnny hooker is a young con-man who is being taught by luther. one day they pull one of their con jobs and net themselves a huge roll. what they don't know is that the man they conned is the courier for a numbers runner. and it turns out that the boss, doyle lonigan, considers it an attack on him and orders all the people involved terminated. hooker is shaken down by a crooked cop, snyder, who threatens to turn him over to lonigan unless he pays him off. hooker pays him, he then tries to warn luther but is too late. he then goes to see henry gondorf, a friend of luther's and a one time great con-man, who has had a bit of bad luck. after hearing what happened to luther and seeing how hungry hooker is for payback, he assembles a gang and decides to con lonigan. while everything seems to be going ok, there is just the problem of the hit on hooker and snyder, whom hooker paid off with counterfeit money.        written by  rcs0411@yahoo.com it's september, 1936. the place: joliet, illinois. luther coleman, his apprentice johnny hooker, and their underling joe erie's latest swindle has netted them $11,000, enough for an aged luther to contemplate retiring from grifting. they are unaware however that that money belonged to ruthless racketeer doyle lonnegan, whose thugs kill luther in retaliation. before luther's death, he suggested to hooker that he contact henry gondorff, his old friend in chicago to learn the art of the big con. hooker does contact gondorff, who has retired after being burned in his last big con. gondorff decides to come out of retirement solely to help hooker get back at lonnegan for luther's murder. in pulling off the big con, gondorff and hooker require the assistance of a number of gondorff's old associates as well as a number of small time grifters. in the latter group includes erie, who wants to do his small part in revenging luther's death. beyond lonnegan or anyone else finding out about the con, there are many potential obstacles in pulling off the sting, such as a controlling and overly cautious lonnegan wanting to do things his own way, and a number of people chasing after hooker, including a crooked joliet vice cop named snyder, lonnegan's lower level thugs and a hired hit man. through the process, hooker, who sees himself as being a wheeler dealer, may come across a better deal than that provided to him by gondorff.        written by  huggo in chicago in september 1936, a young con man seeking revenge for his murdered partner teams up with a master of the big con to win a fortune from a criminal banker.     written by  anonymous synopsis it is 1936 and a money runner is carrying the week's take -- $11,000 -- from an illegal gambling outfit in
