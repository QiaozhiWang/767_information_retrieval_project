kenneth lawrence, david's best friend; janet walker, david's current girlfriend, and ken's ex; henry kentley, david's father; and mrs. atwater, a visiting friend of mr. kentley's. although phillip is nervous enough by the presence of any of these guests as well their loyal housekeeper mrs. wilson, he is most nervous by their last guest, rupert cadell, their former prep school house master, who they consider their intellectual equal, and who had in the past stated openly that murder can be justified in certain circumstances. at the party, brandon prides himself in the open innuendo of the discussion which makes sense if one knows about david's murder. the question becomes whether this innuendo or any other issue will unmask brandon and phillip's act and thus make it less than the perfect murder they assume it is.        written by  huggo manhattan socialites brandon shaw and phillip morgan choke the life out of an associate, david, as an intellectual challenge to commit the perfect murder. not content to escape the penalty of law by simply disposing of the body quietly, they furthermore devise an elaborate and dangerous display of arrogance: the two stuff david's lifeless body into a chest and throw a dinner party serving their guests, literally, from the convenient tabletop of the young man's grave. in attendance are mr. henry kentley and mrs. anita atwater, the victim's father and aunt; kenneth turner, the victim's rival for the hand of janet walker, david's fiancée, who also attends; mrs. wilson, the servant; and rupert cadell, the murderers' former teacher whose flippant repartee regarding social caste festered into the pathological short circuit that led to brandon's and phillip's crime. brandon's sense of intellectual superiority swells to reckless levels throughout the evening as he makes a nail-biting game out of cleverly dropping his guests hints at nasty goings on. meanwhile, phillip grows increasingly frightful and guilt-ridden as rupert inches ever closer to discovering why david hasn't yet arrived at the party.        written by  craig c. bailey  ccb@together.net two arrogant young men, philip morgan and brandon shaw, kill a friend for no apparent reason other than to show they can get away with it. they put their victim, david kentley, in a chest in the living room where they are having a party later that evening. the guests include david's father and also one of their former teachers, rupert cadell. as the evening wears on brandon, clearly the bolder of the two perpetrators, continually pushes his chances becoming ever bolder. philip, on the other hand, begins to regret what they have done and combined with too much alcohol, begins to act oddly. all this leading cadell to start wondering exactly what they have done.        written by  garykmcd two young men strangle their "inferior" classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and invite his friends and family to a dinner party as a means to challenge the "perfection" of their crime.     written by  anonymous synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page rope storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users alfred hitchcock's 30 best movies  created 24 oct 2010      my favourite  created 09 may 2014      must watch - classics  created 29 oct 2014      30 favorite films of 1948  created 9 months ago      filmer som skal sees  created 5 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
