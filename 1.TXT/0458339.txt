"captain america" breaks into red skull's hq with the help of peggy carter and howard stark, and captain america saves everyone. and everyone begins to realize what captain america can really do.        steve rogers, a rejected military soldier transforms into captain america after taking a dose of a "super-soldier serum". but being captain america comes at a price as he attempts to take down a war monger and a terrorist organization.     written by  anonymous synopsis bright headlights cut through a thick sheet of snow-flakes. a scientist, bundled as warmly as possible...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page captain america: the first avenger storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users the 29 new movies made from comics  created 04 jul 2011      vistos 2012  created 23 aug 2012      great movies from '10 to '14  created 26 apr 2014      movies i've seen  created 09 nov 2014      my favourite movies  created 6 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
