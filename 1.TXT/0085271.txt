death itself.        written by  eric van bezooijen  eric@webmethods.com alex terson is head of the scientific research organization, research for a better tomorrow, where soon to be divorced dr. michael brace and karen brace both work. michael and his colleague dr. lillian reynolds, the lead researchers, have just had a breakthrough on their now ten year old project, triad, where they can transfer senses - touch, smell, taste, sight and sound - experienced by one person to another via transfer of brainwaves. they can record the brainwaves for later use. the next step in the project is to create a more user friendly apparatus instead of the now bulky and heavy headgear required, karen who is assigned head of the design team. but as michael and lillian work more on the project, they learn that they can also transfer emotional experiences from person to person. the industrial military complex is ultimately able to hijack the project from michael and lillian with alex's seeming blessing, the military who wants to use it for purposes not part of the original vision that lillian, michael and alex had. that new military vision includes brainwashing and torture. the project team, led by michael and karen, try to sabotage the work of the military before michael and lillian's work can be used for these less than ethical purposes.        written by  huggo a research scientist has been experimenting with a revolutionary brain-reading device. this wondrous machine is able to read a person's thought processes and translate these to videotape. when the scientist wants to study the brainwaves of his late partner, he finds himself seriously at odds with his superiors-not to mention several ominous-looking government types.        written by  soporific synopsis douglas trumball (of 2001: a space odyssey, special effects fame,) directs this 70mm dolby stereo sci-fi classic...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page brainstorm storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users ciencia ficci√≥n con sabor a roble...  created 03 oct 2012      cyberpunk or near : enter the element  created 02 may 2013      this is not for you...  created 22 sep 2014      the best of christopher walken  created 07 dec 2014      own  created 2 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
