it's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil the plans of the scientist and to save the earth.        written by  anthony pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} the evil scientist dr. clayton forrester locks mike nelson and two robots in a spacecraft to watch terrible low-budget movies as part of his scheme to conquer the world. he projects 1954 "this island earth" (title (brazil): "guerra entre planetas") with the intention of driving them crazy. however, the trio laughs and makes funny comments in every scene and dialogs, having good-time instead, and dr. forrester's ambitious plan does not work.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil this movie is basically a deluxe version of the popular cult-tv favorite 'mystery science theater 3000.' in the movie, as in the tv-series, dr. clayton forrester forces mike nelson and his two robots to watch bad b-movies. as these movies are screened for them (and us), we see the theater seats and them silhouetted against the bottom of the screen. their running commentary riffs off of the film and each other and their sophomoric jabs at humor form a continuous patter not unlike what might be heard among the audience, if these films were to be shown at a frat party. this particular episode features 'this island earth' (1954).        written by  tad dibbern  dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu mike nelson and his robot companions watch and give their comments about  this island earth written by  kenneth chisholm synopsis the film, based on the hit television series, opens inside the lab of the evil dr. clayton forrester (trace bellieu)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page mystery science theater 3000: the movie storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
