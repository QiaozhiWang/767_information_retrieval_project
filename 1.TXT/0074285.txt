school senior carrie white is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. her mother, margaret white, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. she even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to carrie. mrs. white's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband ralph long ago having run off with another woman. the only adult authority figure who tries to help carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, miss collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how mrs. white chooses to raise carrie, mrs. white whose beliefs are well known in the community. an impromptu event that happens among carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. one of those students, self absorbed chris hargensen, vows revenge against carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. another student however, the popular sue snell, begins to feel sorry for carrie. in wanting to help her get out of her shell, sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular tommy ross, to take carrie to the senior prom instead of her. this move does not sit well with mrs. white, who in her extreme view believes carrie will fall prey to sin. all these competing issues lead to carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.        written by  huggo carrie white is a shy young girl who doesn't make friends easily. after her classmates teased her about her horrified reaction to her unexpected first period, one of them takes pity on her and gets tommy ross, her boyfriend and class hunk to invite carrie to the senior prom. meanwhile, another girl who has been banned from the prom for her continued aggressive behavior is not as forgiving and plans a prank to embarrass carrie in front of the whole school. what she doesn't realise is that carrie is... gifted with deadly powers, and you really don't want to make her angry.        written by  mark thompson  mrt@oasis.icl.co.uk the story of carrie white, a girl brought up, almost in isolation, by her domineering, religious mother margaret. after an embarrassing incident in the showers causes her classmates to tease carrie ruthlessly, her teacher miss collins disciplines them severely. however, one of the students feels sorry for what she did and asks her boyfriend to take carrie to the senior prom instead of her. determined to have revenge, the other students hatch a plot against carrie, which turns horribly wrong when carrie's strange mental powers are unleashed during the school prom.        written by  goth  brooks@odie.ee.wits.ac.za carrie white is the outsider of her class. she's a mousy girl, all of her classmates hate her, and her mother is a religious fanatic who walks around in a black cape. after she unexpectedly has her first period, she is teased by the girls more ruthlessly than before. the gym teacher punishes the girls that were involved and one of them, sue snell, feels sorry for what she did and asks her boyfriend to take carrie to the prom instead of her. but another girl that has been banned from the prom, chris hargenson, isn't so forgiving and hatches an evil plan with her boyfriend that involves carrie and a bucket full of pig's blood. but what
