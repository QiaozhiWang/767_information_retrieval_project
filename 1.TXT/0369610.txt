       jurassic world has been running with great success for more than a decade in the wake of the disaster that haunted the island 22 years ago. the park's geneticists have once again broken scientific and ethical boundaries in order to raise attendance for the park, now experiencing a decline in happy customers. convinced that the new attraction will bring in many more people, but having crossed the line once again, the results may be devastating.        written by  ed morales 22 years after john hammond envisioned a theme park full of dinosaurs, jurassic world is a reality. although it is everything he originally hoped it would be, attendance in the last decade has been lackluster. with the future of the park hanging in the balance, ingen scientists genetically engineer a new hybrid "attraction". when their new creation turns on them, will anyone get out alive?        written by  mario saltalamacchia twenty-two years after the events of jurassic park, isla nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, jurassic world, as originally envisioned by john hammond. after 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfill a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitors' interest, which backfires horribly.        written by  ingen159260 the new jurassic world, owned by the corporation of simon masrani operates in isla nublar, central america, with dinosaurs genetically created by the ingen company. the workaholic and uptight manager claire dearing receives her nephews gray and zach in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the boys. meanwhile the dedicated owen grady is training four velociraptors and the ingen security guard vic hoskins believes that the animal can be trained for military use. when owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur indominus rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men and flees from the spot. owen escapes and asks masrani to kill the indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. however the team is destroyed by the indominus and claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. but the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. meanwhile gray and zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and claire and owen seek them out. with the chaos in the island, vic assumes the command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the indominus. will his plan work?
