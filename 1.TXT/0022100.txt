anyone - is apprehended for the heinous crimes. conversely, many want to take the case into their own hands, including the town's leading criminals since the increased police presence has placed a strain on their ability to conduct criminal activity. although they both have the same end goal of capturing the murderer, the police and the criminals seem to be working at cross purposes, which may provide an edge to the murderer in getting away.        written by  huggo in berlin in the early 1930's, children are being lured to their death by a psychopathic killer. in the space of a year, 8 children have been murdered. the police have redoubled their efforts to find the guilty man but have yet to find him and citizens are beginning to dispense their own justice on otherwise innocent people. the heads of the city's criminal element are paying a high price due to the increased police presence and decide to find the psychopath on their own. they approach the beggars union to have their members blanket the city with spies. they're successful in finding the killer and put him on trial in their own special court but the police make progress and have their own views on how justice should be administered.        written by  garykmcd a psychotic child murderer stalks a city, and despite an exhaustive investigation fueled by public hysteria and outcry, the police have been unable to find him. but the police crackdown does have one side-affect, it makes it nearly impossible for the organized criminal underground to operate. so they decide that the only way to get the police off their backs is to catch the murderer themselves. besides, he is giving them a bad name.        written by  ken yousten  kyousten@bev.net when the police in a german city are unable to catch a child-murderer, other criminals join in the manhunt.     written by  anonymous synopsis it's noon. concerned parents are lined up outside the schools waiting to escort their kids home for lunch...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page m storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users widely praised films i still need to see...  created 21 mar 2011      filmes 2012  created 29 may 2012      100 top imdb  created 12 feb 2014      film visti non totalmente  created 04 aug 2014      favorite movie endings  created 25 nov 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
