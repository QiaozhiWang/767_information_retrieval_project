"scream: the inside story" features all-new interviews with wes craven, neve campell, david arquette, jamie kennedy, rose mcgowan and matthew lillard along with the many other cast and crew.        written by  anonymous synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page scream: the inside story storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users movies i must see  created 16 jul 2011      films watched (ongoing list)  created 02 aug 2012      most of the horror films i have seen  created 16 oct 2012      2011  created 30 jul 2013      horror: documentary/biography  created 17 sep 2013      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
