       written by  soumitra after a number of people are killed and a cargo ship set on fire, roger 'verbal' kint is questioned by u.s. customs agent dave kujan. reluctant at first, verbal begins to tell them what happened starting with when he met four men, all criminals, sharing a holding cell for a few hours. together, they join forces to successfully hijack a jewel shipment and head to los angeles to lay low. there they are contacted by a lawyer, kobayashi, representing the much-feared international criminal keyser söze who wants them to do a job for him. the result is the attack on the cargo ship. verbal refuses to give evidence in the case and is set free. only then does kujan realize what's really happened.        written by  garykmcd police investigating an exploded boat on a san pedro pier discover 27 bodies and $91 million worth of drug money. the only survivors are a severely burned and very scared hungarian terrorist and verbal kint, a crippled con-man. reluctantly, kint is pressured into explaining exactly what happened on the boat. his story begins six weeks earlier with five criminals being dragged in by new york police desperate for suspects on a hijacked truck and ends with the possible identification of a criminal mastermind.        written by  john weeks  j.t.weeks1@student.derby.ac.uk after a waterfront explosion, verbal, an eye-witness and participant tells the story of events leading up to the conflagration. the story begins when five men are rounded up for a line-up, and grilled about a truck hijacking (the usual suspects). least pleased is keaton: a crooked cop - exposed, indicted, but now desperately trying to go straight. the cops won't leave him alone, however, and as they wait for their lawyers to post bail, he is talked into doing one more job with the other four. all goes tolerably well until the influence of the legendary, seemingly omnipotent "keyser söze" is felt. although set in the modern day, it has much of the texture of the forties, plus suspense, intrigue (a fairly high body count), and lots of twists in the plot.        written by  phil.kilby@dit.csiro.au this is a film about five men who are hauled into the new york police station because a crime was committed and they are the usual suspects. they all agree to do a job together for a little revenge. however, little do they know that someone else has the strings and that they are all the puppets--all because each of them crossed the wrong person at the wrong time. after the big job, 27 people are dead, and there are two survivors. but the question is...who's the one controlling everything?        written by  thexotherxchris a sole survivor tells of the twisty events leading up to a horrific gun battle on a boat, which begin when five criminals meet at a seemingly random police lineup.     written by  skip_4591 synopsis on the deck of a ship in san pedro, california, a figure identified as keyser speaks with an injured man called keaton...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the usual suspects storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
