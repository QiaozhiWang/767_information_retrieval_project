major clipton, the pragmatic medical officer; and us navy commander shears who is more concerned about his own well being and that of those around him than he is about the big picture of the war. against the assertions of its futility by both saito and nicholson, three pows try to escape - among them being shears - with all being shot. everyone believes shears is dead, but he manages to survive and make it out of the jungle back to safety. at the camp, a battle of wills ensues between nicholson and saito, specifically regarding the illegal use of pow officers as laborers to build the bridge. nicholson wins the respect of the pows because of this standoff. but nicholson ultimately has other thoughts, namely taking control of the building of a proper, well made bridge to replace the haphazard one currently being directed by saito. nicholson's rationale is that it will raise the morale of the pows by giving them something constructive to do, while demoralizing the enemy by showing them the superiority of the british. meanwhile, as shears is convalescing at a beach-side military hospital in ceylon, he is certain he will get his wish of a medical discharge. his plans are disrailed when he is asked to participate in a british led four man commando mission to destroy the bridge under the command of major warden, the antithesis of shears in that he can only see the big picture without seeing the personal cost to those around him. this offer is one that shears cannot refuse. the four understand the risks - the perils of the jungle and the japanese - but they may not fully realize that their biggest threat for carrying out the mission successfully is nicholson's pride.        written by  huggo after settling his differences with a japanese pow camp commander, a british colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors - while oblivious to a plan by the allies to destroy it.     written by  chris white synopsis in the middle of world war ii, two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a japanese pow camp in southern burma...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the bridge on the river kwai storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users my top 35 classics  created 18 aug 2011      disappointing choices for best picture  created 11 apr 2012      prison drama  created 29 jan 2015      some thing  created 7 months ago      best of 1950's  created 1 week ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
