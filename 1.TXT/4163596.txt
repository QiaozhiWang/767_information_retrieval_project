can she really stretch her emotional boundaries and have a true upliftment of her inner self ( a true bodhon or awakening)?        written by  director the story is contemporary, happening in today's globalized world in a high middle class family, archi and ishani, in modern kolkata, india. during the first day of the goddess durga festival a problem comes unexpectedly to the family and they fight it for six days. but there is a deeper crisis in ishani's life - a flashback of ten years, which starts expectedly but gets into a different unchartered territory when she embarks on a personal journey to realize a dream. it is a silent battle for ishani - a crisis of a woman - trial of a mother. can she win it?
