"mac" - serving time for several assaults and statutory rape, has just been transferred from a labor camp associated with eastern oregon correctional institution in pendleton to a psychiatric hospital. mac has been able to use acting "crazy" - having a belligerent and smart-alecky attitude and anti-authoritarian behavior - to his benefit in not having to do any work. he is at the hospital as the authorities at pendleton want him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to prove he is not crazy, believing this is all an act to get out of work. he believes this stint will get him out of any more work while he serves out the remainder of his sentence. he is placed in a ward with a group of men who have differing degrees of lucidity and control of their mental faculties. he continues to behave in the same manner as always to get what he wants, using the other patients either as accessories or things for his own amusement. he adds to his list of goals to do anything to annoy the ward's tyrannical head nurse, miss mildred ratched, whose seeming want is to break the spirit of any of the men in her care. in his battle with nurse ratched, mac eventually tries to help the men get a voice of their own while in the hospital, and for some for their eventual return to the outside world.        written by  huggo mcmurphy thinks he can get out of doing work while in prison by pretending to be mad. his plan backfires when he is sent to a mental asylum. he tries to liven the place up a bit by playing card games and basketball with his fellow inmates, but the head nurse is after him at every turn.        written by  colin tinto  cst@imdb.com mcmurphy, a man with several assault convictions to his name, finds himself in jail once again. this time, the charge is statutory rape when it turns out that his girlfriend had lied about being eighteen, and was, in fact, fifteen (or, as mcmurphy puts it, "fifteen going on thirty-five"). rather than spend his time in jail, he convinces the guards that he's crazy enough to need psychiatric care and is sent to a hospital. he fits in frighteningly well, and his different point of view actually begins to cause some of the patients to progress. nurse ratched becomes his personal cross to bear as his resistance to the hospital routine gets on her nerves.        written by  john vogel  jlvogel@comcast.net and j.d. a criminal pleads insanity after getting into trouble again and once in the mental institution rebels against the oppressive nurse and rallies up the scared patients.     synopsis in 1963 oregon, randle patrick mcmurphy (nicholson), a criminal who has been sentenced to a fairly short prison term...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page one flew over the cuckoo's nest storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users already seen  created 02 feb 2012      seen it  created 15 apr 2012      fav.  created 30 jan 2013      best movie for ever  created 16 nov 2013      best movie ever (part 5)  created 12 oct 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
