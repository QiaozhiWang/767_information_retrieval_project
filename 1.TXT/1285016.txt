"the social network" explores the moment at which facebook was invented--through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. the movie moves from the halls of harvard to the cubicles of palo alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. in the midst of the chaos are mark zuckerberg (jesse eisenberg), the brilliant harvard student who conceived a web site; eduardo saverin (andrew garfield), once zuckerberg's close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; napster founder sean parker (justin timberlake), who brought facebook to silicon valley's venture capitalists; and the winklevoss twins (armie hammer and josh pence), the harvard classmates who asserted that zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. each has his own narrative, his own version of the facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well.        written by  columbia pictures as told through flashbacks via deposition hearings for two concurrent lawsuits, the development and early days of the social networking website facebook is presented. harvard students  mark zuckerberg and eduardo saverin - officially listed as the co-founders of the website - were once best friends. based on an on-line blog about his ex-girlfriend and a site he developed allowing its users to rate the hotness factor of girls on campus, zuckerberg, who exhibited a streak of arrogance, was asked by fellow harvardites, wealthy twins  cameron winklevoss and  tyler winklevoss written by  huggo not very good at expressing himself in person, mark zuckerberg (jesse eisenberg) first alienates himself from his girlfriend, who feels conversing with him is like working the 'stairmaster', while taking strong exception to his condescending remarks towards her. he and his buddy, eduardo saverin (andrew garfield), plagiarize a proposed networking website from cameron and tyler winklevoss, and divya narendra, made exclusively for harvadites - re-naming it 'the facebook'. this site connects students, describes what drives life in college, who's single, and how to hook-up with girls. both then are approached by napster-fame sean parker (justin timberlake), and upon his advise, 'the' is removed - giving birth to the now-revolutionary 'facebook' - that can be accessed by anyone worldwide - not just a few exclusive campuses. but his competitiveness, inability to communicate, and the urge to be number one, will alienate him, and result in two lawsuits - one from the winklevoss twins - and the second from none other than eduardo himself.        written by  rajoo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) the story of the creators of facebook and the subsequent legal battles that stretched out over several years. told mostly in flashbacks while mark zuckerman gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school's database and published the photos of all the women at the school. one of his roommates, eduardo saverin, provides the upfront financing and zuckerman deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. the relationship with saverin deteriorates and he soon finding himself on the outside looking in. all in all, an unflattering picture of all those involved.        written by  garykmcd harvard student  mark zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as facebook, but is later sued by two brothers who claimed he stole their idea, and the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.     written by  jgp3553@yahoo.com synopsis in october 2003, harvard university student mark zuckerberg ( ) has the idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female harvard undergraduates after his girlfriend erica albright ( ) breaks up with him...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the social network storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
