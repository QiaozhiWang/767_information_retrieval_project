       written by  jhailey@hotmail.com at age forty-one, robert danvers is renowned for being an ego-maniacal celebrity chef and culinary critic who hosts his own london based gourmet food television show called "good taste". but he's equally renowned for being a womanizing cad who has a revolving door of women coming and going. he's met his match in a nineteen year old american named marion, who picks up him up without knowing who he is or anything about his public or personal life. but she seems to immediately know what he's all about. she admits that she wants to stay one step ahead of him in their sexual game. despite their bumpy start or perhaps because of it, she moves into his flat a day after knowing him and accompanies him on a business trip to the south of france. this being a relationship totally foreign to both, can it last, or will it last because it is different than all the previous casual relationships they've had up until now?
