(translated as "little guy" in the english subtitles, played by milton de la canal. the actual translation is "dwarf".) the family adopts new identities and attempts to lead a normal life. later, they are joined by a student who is using the alias lucas (tomás fonzi). their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents (fernanda mistral and héctor alterio) reveals that they are still a close-knit family. subtly hinted, however, and used as a metaphor, is the mother's constant smoking and el enano's renewed bed-wetting. both serve to show how stressful and precarious their situation is.        written by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kamchatka_(film) synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page kamchatka storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users the movies that i liked most  created 16 aug 2012      vistos dvd 2013  created 21 jan 2013      argentina  created 14 sep 2013      best argentine films  created 19 apr 2014      filmes assistidos em 2014  created 14 may 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
