in the twenty-third century, the universe is threatened by evil. the only hope for mankind is the fifth element, who comes to earth every five thousand years to protect the humans with four stones of the four elements: fire, water, earth and air. a mondoshawan spacecraft is bringing the fifth element back to earth but it is destroyed by the evil mangalores. however, a team of scientists use the dna of the remains of the fifth element to rebuild the perfect being called leeloo. she escapes from the laboratory and stumbles upon the taxi driver and former elite commando major korben dallas that helps her to escape from the police. leeloo tells him that she must meet father vito cornelius to accomplish her mission. meanwhile, the evil uses the greedy and cruel jean-baptiste emanuel zorg and a team of mercenary mangalores to retrieve the stones and avoid the protection of leeloo. but the skilled korben dallas has fallen in love with leeloo and decides to help her to retrieve the stones.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is threatened by the arrival of evil. only the fifth element can stop the evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. she is assisted by a former elite commando turned cab driver, korben dallas, who is, in turn, helped by prince/arsenio clone, ruby rhod. unfortunately, evil is being assisted by mr. zorg, who seeks to profit from the chaos that evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.        written by  david j. gannon  dganno01@exch.eds.com there are cycles in the universe when great evil threatens all life in the universe. the ultimate weapon against evil, devised long ago, is called "the fifth element", stored on earth for safekeeping. when a professor discovered it in the 1910's, he found it very astonishing. however, a group of beings known as the monascheiwans came to earth to take the fifth element to utilize it for their own well-being, promising to return it in time for the next cycle. in the distant future of the 2200's, the earth is a very different place, yet much the same... people smoke, break laws, make messes. in the megalopolis of new york, a former elite commando named korban dallas is now a taxi driver. as the monascheiwans were returning the fifth element to earth to fend of the rising evil, they are destroyed by a ruthless race of beings known as mangalores. discovered in the remains of the monascheiwans' ship, is a remnant of the fifth element, from which they re-create "the perfect being", the fifth element, named "leeloo", who drops in on korban dallas in his cab... literally. dallas keeps her free from government control and brings her to a priest named vito cornillius, who, seeing the coming evil in the prophecies, is attempting to find the elemental stones needed to power the fifth element. he is getting in the way of a ruthless businessman named zorg, who is already operating under the sway of evil.        written by  john wiggins in the colorful future, a cab driver unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep evil and mr zorg at bay.     written by  murray chapman synopsis the story's premise is that every five thousand years, in conjunction with a planetary arrangement, a 'great evil' appears whose purpose is to destroy
