regardless, the follow-up issue was what to do with whoever the traitor when his identity was truly discovered if that ever did occur.        written by  huggo set in a german pow camp for enlisted american airmen, a spy is discovered to be living in one of the prison barracks after an escape attempt fails resulting in the deaths of two inmates. the prisoners at once suspect sefton, an unscrupulous inside dealer who trades almost anything with the germans for extra privileges. after sefton is beaten up, he himself determines to find the real spy and the result is a mixture of intrigue and betrayal leading to a surprise ending.        written by  anthony hughes  husnock31@hotmail.com a group of airmen are in a german prisoner of war camp. each escape attempt has resulted in failure and a spy is suspected. when the materially successful operator comes under suspicion, he becomes an outcast. when a new arrival is accused of being a spy and saboteur, the camp unites to hide him as the operator looks for the real plant.        written by  john vogel  jlvogel@comcast.net no one has ever escaped from stalag 17, a pow camp for american airmen near the danube. maybe that's because there's a spy in barracks four. the german guards seem to know everything that's happening before it happens. most of the american pows suspect sergeant j.j. sefton, whose wheeling-and-dealing rates him special privileges from the camp guards. when lieutenant dunbar arrives at the prison camp, and is accused of blowing up an ammunition train, the american prisoners must expose the stoolie before he informs the germans where dunbar is hiding, and get dunbar out of the "unescapable" camp before the ss arrives to take him into custody.        written by  chris bower  chrisbower78@hotmail.com when two escaping american world war ii prisoners are killed, the german pow camp barracks black marketeer, j.j. sefton, is suspected of being an informer.     written by  alfiehitchie synopsis captured americans coping with life in a german pow camp in world war ii are puzzled by the simplicity with which the germans are able to stave off escape attempts...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page stalag 17 storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
