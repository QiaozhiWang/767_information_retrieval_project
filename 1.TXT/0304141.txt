convicted mass murderer, sirius black, has escaped from the wizarding prison azkaban. black is known as lord voldemort's most devoted follower, and he's after harry to avenge voldemort and finish the job. but not everything is what it seems, and inside of hogwarts there may just be a traitor...        written by  esamey written by  trinka harry's life is in mortal danger yet again, this time more than ever. first, a killer named sirus black has escaped from azkaban prison, and it seems that he broke out just to finish what his master wanted to do 13 years ago: kill harry potter!. also, for harry's protection, azkaban has sent hundreds of dementors to guard hogwarts in an attempt to catch black. but will they turn out to be a great help or a big mistake?        written by  prince approaching his third year at hogwarts, harry potter has had enough of his muggle relatives. he runs away from them (finally) and enters his third term facing trouble from more than one side: for using magic outside the school and from the news that a notorious criminal, serial killer sirius black, has escaped the wizard's prison at azkaban and apparently is headed for harry. the school calls in supernatural help against black in the form of dementors, but unusual things continue to put harry in peril. he is thrown into a confusing panoply of shifting alliegences and shifting shapes where nobody is who or what they seem. who is the real criminal? what is the real crime? who is telling or knows the truth?        written by  anonymous it's harry's third year at hogwarts; not only does he have a new "defense against the dark arts" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. convicted murderer sirius black has escaped the wizards' prison and is coming after harry.     written by  m00nliteaddict@yahoo.com synopsis it opens at the dursleys' home where harry potter (daniel radcliffe) lives and is staying, as usual...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page window.generic = window.generic || {};
