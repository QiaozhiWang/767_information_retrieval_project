       written by  jeremy perkins {j-26} st. trinian's has the worst reputation of any girls' private school in britain, that bad reputation extending from the facilities, to the administration, to the staff and faculty, to the students themselves. the student body has its separate cliques as does any school, the cliques having the common bond of being equally subversive, being aided in their subversiveness by a shady character named flash harry. the one student who doesn't fit in is straight-laced and meek annabelle fritton, a recent transfer from cheltenham ladies' college, where she butted heads with the stuck up bullies who led the student body, especially verity thwaites. annabelle's paternal aunt is st. trinian's spinster headmistress, camilla fritton. annabelle does whatever she can to make her father, carnaby fritton, take her away to anywhere else but st. trinian's. the new minister of education, geoffrey thwaites, who happens to be verity's father, wants to clean up the school system by making an example of st. trinian's. what geoffrey does may be affected by his long history with miss fritton, who he didn't know is the school's headmistress. st. trinian's faces further problems when the bank will soon foreclose if they cannot make full payment on their Â£500,000 debt. this situation combined with finding out why her father sent her st. trinian's leads to annabelle finding her place for the first time in her life. the girls find out about the problems, and although have no attachment to the school itself, come to the realization that they truly have a sense of community amongst themselves, and as such decide to work with flash harry to devise some plan to come up with the money to keep the school open. the plan will take all of their collective cunning to devise and pull off, which includes the not so easy task of making it into the finals of the national school challenge, an academic competition between schools. they have other obstacles including geoffrey and verity, who continue to want to show up st. trinian's and annabelle respectively at any opportunity.        written by  huggo in order to save their bankrupt school, a group of troublesome girls stage a robbery with a group of geniuses on their tails.     written by  dylan penrose synopsis st trinian's is an anarchical school for uncontrollable girls in london, england who try to save the school from bankruptcy by stealing the painting 'girl with a pearl earring'...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page st. trinian's storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
