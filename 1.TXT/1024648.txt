competing priorities in washington between the six and the fifty plus hostages; the taylors' iranian housekeeper, sahar, who comes to the realization that the taylors' supposed canadian house guests are not who they say they are; and a mug shot book of embassy staff among the shredded materials, which iranian sweat shop workers are tasked with putting back together, and which if achieved would identify the fact that the militants are minus six people from among their hostages.        written by  huggo in 1979, the islamic revolution overthrows the dictator shah mohammad reza pahlavi, who came to power sponsored by the united states government, and the leader of the revolution, ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, assumes the power. the iranian revolutionaries invade the american embassy in tehran and the american officials are taken hostages. however, six officials flee from the embassy and are secretly hosted by the canadian ambassador at his residence in tehran and the cia directors summon the agent tony mendez, who is an expert in bringing american citizens back to their country, to plot a rescue plan to save the group. tony mendez plots the most incredible plan to bring the six officials: to create a fake canadian film to be shot in iran and include the officials in the production crew. without other alternative, tony mendez receives green light from his superiors and travels to hollywood to set in motion his almost impossible mission to rescue the group.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil acting under the cover of a hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a cia agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six americans in tehran during the u.s. hostage crisis in iran in 1980.     written by  jgp3553@yahoo.com synopsis the movie begins with a brief history of the persian empire, leading up to more modern times, when the iranian leadership was overthrown in 1953...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page argo storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users with nergissss..  created 14 dec 2011      2012  created 19 jan 2012      Ã  voir !!!  created 29 feb 2012      golden globe winners (drama)  created 28 nov 2013      watched  created 03 aug 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
