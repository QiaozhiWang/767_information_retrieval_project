that is the chaff of the wheat. the baker is obliged to pay twice as much as formerly for his flour and so must charge twice as much for the loaf. consequently, many a poor soul must go hungry. furthermore, the bread fund for the poor is cut down, and many a shivering wretch stands in the line only to be denied bread when his turn comes. there is no vengeance possible here but the hand of god, and god's vengeance when wreaked is terrible and unconditional, and one of the sins that cries to heaven for vengeance is denying food to the hungry. this cry is heard, and as the king is showing his friends through the elevators into the bins of which are flowing the steady stream of his golden grain, he trips and falls into one of the bins and is buried. he has been called before his god to answer. our thoughts are carried back to the bent and knotted forms of the sowers trudging along, ignorant of the vengeance of the wheat.        written by  moving picture world synopsis synopsis be the first to contribute!
