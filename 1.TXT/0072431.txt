the grandson of the more famous dr. victor frankenstein, who did experiments on bringing back the dead, tries to disassociate himself from his more famous relative, even to the point of pronouncing their surname differently. regardless, frederick is drawn back to the small transylvannian town and castle where victor conducted his experiments, he leaving behind his somewhat standoffish and "untouchable" fianc√©e, elizabeth, back in the us. he also slowly begins to get drawn into the research that his grandfather conducted, he eventually learns not by accident. as frederick tries to reanimate his dead subject with the help of his hunchbacked aide igor and his beautiful assistant inga, rumors abound in the town of what he is doing, they who have been trying to disassociate
