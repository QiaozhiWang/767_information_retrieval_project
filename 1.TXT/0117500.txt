d.c., is a biochemist who works for the fbi. soon after his fianc√©e carla pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant, stanley gets a call from fbi director james womack. womack tells stanley that san francisco's alcatraz island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine general francis xavier hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. the death of his wife barbara hummel on march 9, 1995 drove general hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. stanley is needed because general hummel has stolen some vx gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto san francisco unless his demands are met. stanley knows how to disarm the bombs, but stanley needs someone who knows alcatraz well enough to get him inside. that man is former british intelligence agent john patrick mason, who has been in prison for the past 30 years without a trial because he was accused of stealing the private files of  j. edgar hoover written by  todd baldridge a group of renegade marine commandos seizes a stockpile of chemical weapons and takes over alcatraz, with 81 tourists as hostages. their leader, a former highly-decorated u.s. general, demands $100 million to be paid in ransom, as restitution to families of marines who died in covert operations and were thereby denied compensation. otherwise, he is threatening to launch 15 rockets carrying deadly vx nerve gas into the san francisco bay area. an elite seal team, with support from an fbi chemical warfare expert (stanley goodspeed) and a former alcatraz escapee (john patrick mason), is assembled to penetrate the terrorists' defenses on alcatraz and neutralize the rocket threat before time runs out.        written by  tad dibbern  dibbern_d@a1.mscf.upenn.edu it's a quiet day in san francisco. there are 81 civilians on a tour of alcatraz, the prison famous for the fact that no prisoner had ever successfully escaped. during one of the tours, marine general francis xavier hummel takes the civilians hostage, with the help of other marines. he has 15 rockets of deadly v.x. gas at his disposal, ready to launch at san francisco. his reason for doing this is simple: he has seen marines under his command get killed in combat without a military burial or benefits to their families. he makes a threat to the fbi: give the fallen marines recognition or he will launch the v.x. rockets. after learning that one rocket is enough to take out sixty or seventy thousand people, the fbi sends for their top chemical weapons expert: dr. stanley goodspeed, engaged to his pregnant girlfriend. while trying to figure out a countermeasure to the current situation, the fbi is forced to resort to john patrick mason, an ex-con who broke out of alcatraz in 1962.        written by  ridley lavine marine general francis xavier hummel has spent most of his career carrying out covert operations, but there's no record of these operations. over the years, nearly a hundred of his men have been killed or left behind, and they have not received any recognition. after trying to get them that through normal channels, hummel now decides that it's time for drastic measures. he and some other marines take some rockets that are equipped with a biological weapon. they then go on a tour of alcatraz, and take the tourists hostage. he then calls the pentagon and informs them that unless they pay him 100 million dollars as reparation for him, he will launch the rockets. now the pentagon doesn't want to capitulate. so they decide to send in a team of navy seals. now they need someone who knows alcatraz and the best person they could find is john patrick mason, a man who escaped from alcatraz, and who has been in every prison in the u.s. for the past 30 years. also accompanying them is stanley goodspeed, an fbi chemical weapons expert. when they go in, the marines ambush the seals. only mason and goodspeed are left, and the two have to try and neutralize the weapons. only problem is, that goodspeed is not really a man of action and mason knows that when he returns, he will be sent back to prison, and mason doesn't really deserve that.        written by  rcs0411@yahoo.com a group of u.s. marines, under command of a renegade general, take over alcatraz and threaten san francisco bay with biological weapons. a chemical weapons specialist and the only man to have ever escaped from the rock are the only ones who can prevent chaos.        written by  van_whistler@hotmail.co.uk a mild-mannered chemist and an ex-con must lead the counterstrike when a rogue group of military men, led by a renegade general, threaten a nerve gas attack from alcatraz against san francisco.     written by  anonymous synopsis on a rainy morning at arlington national cemetery, brigadier general francis hummel ( ) visits the grave of his
