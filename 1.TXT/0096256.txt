where will your consciousness take you when the sleep is washed from your eyes. welcome to the real world.        written by  cinema_fan john nada is a man without job who walks around a big american city trying to find something to do. he finally finds a job as a worker and a place to spend the nights, but one day something terrible happens to him. john discovers a pair of sun-glasses through which he can see the true face of people. many persons in this city are in fact aliens (from the andromeda) and most of them are important members of our society. they keep humans in ignorance and they rule our world as they like. nada must find the rest of the men that know what's happening (those who made the strange sun-glasses) and join them in the fight against the aliens.        written by  chris makrozahopoulos  makzax@hotmail.com the unemployed construction worker george nada drifts to los angeles and finds a job. nada is a man that believes on the american dream and expects to have his big chance someday. he befriends the worker frank armitage that is a conformist and invites nada to camp in the homeless settlement where he lives. nada observes that the television has weird interferences from a pirate transmission of a man that belongs to an underground movement and notes a strange moving of people in the church on the other side of the settlement. nada sneaks around the church and finds a box with pairs of sunglasses. when he wears the glasses, he discovers that the average people is being dominated and subdue by subliminal messages and several persons are aliens indeed. further, the elites are corroborating with the invaders, receiving financial support in return. nada forces frank to wear the sunglasses and together they seek other humans aware of the situation to organize a resistance against the powerful aliens from andromeda and their associates.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil a drifter discovers a pair of sunglasses that allow him to wake up to the fact that aliens have taken over the earth.     written by  j. spurlin synopsis george nada (roddy piper) is a homeless laborer who arrives in los angeles looking for work. he listens for some seconds to some rambling street preacher (raymond st...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page they live storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users top b-movies  created 19 sep 2012      wake up ... at once  created 09 mar 2015      my movies - t  created 10 months ago      john carpenter  created 9 months ago      cinemadrome of the occult  created 4 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
