       ellen ripley, the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship nostromo, awakens half a century later when she is found by a salvage ship. the welcome given to her by the "company" officials is far from warm, since they refuse to believe her discovery of alien existence and strip her off her flight officer's license. ripley also discovers, much to her horror, that the planet lv-426 where her crew had encountered an alien species for the first time, is now colonized by the company. but when all contact from the planet is lost ripley is called back into action again as an advisor to a team of tough space marines with lots of firepower. to get rid of her recurrent nightmares about the alien creature, ripley prepares for a final battle with the monsters - and this time, there are hundreds of them out there.        written by  soumitra the sequel to alien is a non-stop, high-tech, war movie, with space marines. ripley is found in deep space by a salvage ship, 57 years after narrowly escaping with her life - and her cat - at the end of alien. she then discovers the company have colonised the planet where the alien was first encountered. when contact with the colony is lost, the company send a team of space marines, with ripley as an "advisor", to find out what has happened.        written by  colin tinto  cst@imdb.com the planet from  alien written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com synopsis see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page aliens storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
