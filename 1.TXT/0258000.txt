emotionally estranged from her cheating ex-husband, pharmaceutical magnate stephen altman - and their street-wise pre-teen daughter sarah altman are spending their first night in their just purchased converted brownstone in the upper west side of manhattan. the conversions, which include a functioning elevator and secure panic room, were made by the now deceased former owner, a wealthy recluse whose family is now fighting over the whereabouts of his vast estate. what meg does not know is that part of that estate - supposedly $3 million - is hidden in a safe in the floor of the panic room, something that burnham, junior and raoul know. junior is the grandson of the previous owner, burnham works for the security company that monitors the security system for the brownstone including its panic room, and raoul is junior's gun-toting hired hand. the three plan on retrieving the money. believing the brownstone still empty, the three criminals break into the brownstone and quickly find that it is not as empty as they believed. when all five realize there are others unexpected in the house, meg and sarah are able to make it into the panic room, but one that as of yet has no functioning telephone, which burnham knows. burnham also knows there is no way for him or his partners to get into the panic room. the five are at a standoff as meg and sarah will not leave the panic room, while the three criminals won't leave until they get the money. as meg and sarah try to figure out how to get a message to the outside world - specifically either to the police or stephen - they are working against time as sarah is a diabetic who does not have access to her insulin. and the three criminals may have other foes besides the altmans, the three who are differing personalities and thus have different motivations in stealing the money. each may have different thoughts on how far they should go to get it.        written by  huggo this story centers around a divorced woman in her 30's and her daughter, who are caught up in a cat-and-mouse game inside their new new york brownstone when three burglars come looking for a hidden cache of cash. mother and daughter hide in the "panic room," a secret room designed for just such a purpose, but still end up fighting for their lives...        written by  laffz00@aol.com when burglars break in to a newly-bought house expecting to find money, they find its owners sleeping upstairs. the odds are against the claustrophobic mother and her child with low blood sugar when they are locked into the panic room, a room where they are "safe" from criminals. unfortunately, they are locked in with the very money that the burglars want...and the burglars threaten to come in...or make the family of two come out.        written by  jordan after her divorce, meg altman and her daughter sarah move into an old-fashioned house with one very modern addition: a "panic room" which is virtually impossible to break into, designed for refuge during a home invasion. in their first night in the house a trio of thieves do break in and meg and sarah rush into the panic room. however, the intruders are looking for something inside the panic room, and given the recent move the room's hotline to the police hasn't been hooked up yet. worse, sarah is diabetic and the room doesn't contain any sugar...        written by  rmlohner a divorced woman and her diabetic daughter take refuge in their newly-purchased house's safe room, when three men break-in, searching for a missing fortune.     written by  paulrichard synopsis meg altman ( ) is searching for a new home with her 11 year-old daughter, sarah ( )...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page panic room storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users horror  created 02 oct 2011      films i've seen  created 31 dec 2011      watched  created 14 jul 2013      list of movies i watched in march 2014  created 01 mar 2014      ranking 2002 films  created 1 month ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
