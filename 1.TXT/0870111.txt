in addition to his producer  john birt bob zelnick and  james reston jr. nixon's chief adviser for the interviews is his current chief of staff, jack brennan. prior to the interviews, ground rules are negotiated, most importantly surrounding watergate: the total percentage of time watergate can be discussed and the definition of what constitutes watergate. as the four interviews progress, each side tries to manipulate the interviews to his best advantage. behind the scenes, frost is having difficulty with the rest of his professional life: his regular talk shows are being canceled and he has not reached anywhere near the total $2 million financing for this project. ultimately, frost has to finance the project with much money out of his own pocket. it isn't until a chance telephone call that the tides turn on the interviews.        written by  huggo a dramatic retelling of the post-watergate television interviews between british talk-show host david frost and former president richard nixon.     written by  anonymous synopsis for a quick background, the movie is based on a series of 1977 interviews between television personality david frost (played by michael sheen) and former president richard nixon (played by frank langella)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page frost/nixon storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users recommended movies  created 09 aug 2011      ron howard best to worst  created 03 jul 2012      just a few titles that is a must see !  created 30 may 2013      nog te downloaden  created 10 jun 2013      andre watchlist  created 02 feb 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
