the other forest animals quickly give into rj, sneaking into the human world to get all the food they can grab. what they don't know is that rj is actually in debt to a hungry bear, who has given him one week to replenish his food supply, or rj takes its place!        written by  lex rj is a raccoon, specialist on finding and stealing food, as every raccoon in the world. during a night, rj tries to steal all the food reserves of vincent, a big bear, but the raccoon's ambition makes that all the food loot get lost. vincent warns rj that he'll should put back all his food when full moon comes, otherwise he will regret having stolen the food. meanwhile, a group of animals headed by a cautious turtle, verne, is worried because spring has come and there's not enough food for everyone. verne tells that they will be fine eating plants and some bark. later, they find that their wood has a frontier, formed by a giant bush. they're scared of crossing to the other side, where the suburbs exist. but rj comes to the scene, telling that there's no danger in the suburbs, and that they will find all the food they want there. nevertheless, verne distrusts rj, because he thinks that there's something suspicious about him, trying to convince the group that natural food is better than junk human food. verne won't be wrong, because rj is only using them to get the food for vincent. a pair of opossums, a family of porcupines, a nervous squirrel and a female skunk, will plan a risky theft to a house, drawing a lot of obstacles, like a silly exterminator, a cat and the neurotic house owner.        written by  alejandro frias when a hungry bear wakes up to see rj, a raccoon, steal his provisions and then accidentally throw them all over the streets, he threatens to kill him if he does not return every single item he took from him. rj has six days to steal from every human's kitchen he can find. he then meets a group of forest animals led by verne, a turtle, and decides to use them for his plan. but as he gets closer to getting what he needed, he realizes that he finally has what he's always wanted : a family.        written by  a.h a scheming raccoon fools a mismatched family of forest creatures into helping him repay a debt of food, by invading the new suburban sprawl that popped up while they were hibernating...and learns a lesson about family himself.     written by  dan farley synopsis spring has arrived and an array of creatures sleeping in a large tree trunk has awakened from their winter hibernation...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page over the hedge storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users some animated kids movies i think you and your kids will enjoy :) (list not yet completed)  created 16 jun 2012      barnefilmer  created 24 jun 2014      animated/cartoon  created 19 jul 2014      iris Ã¤r noob  created 09 mar 2015      dreamworks animated films  created 3 weeks ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet!
