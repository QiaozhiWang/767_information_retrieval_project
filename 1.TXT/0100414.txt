cooper gets a break when lt. tanaka, a communications officer and a christian, surrenders himself...        written by  david stanko on an obscure pacific island just north of australia, the japanese empire has operated a prisoner of war camp for australian soldiers. at the close of world war ii, the liberated pows tell a gruesome tale of mass executions of over eight hundred persons as well as torture style killings of downed australian airmen. in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice, the australian army establishes a war crimes tribunal to pass judgement on the japanese men and officers who ran the ambon camp. in an added twist, a high ranking japanese admiral is implicated, and politics become involoved with justice as american authorities in japan lobby for the admiral's release.        written by  anthony hughes  husnock31@hotmail.com synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page prisoners of the sun storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
