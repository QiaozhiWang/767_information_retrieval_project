he does not have much experience with women. sandy dates susan but jonathan gives a pass on her in the beginning of a triangle of love. a few years later, susan is married with sandy, and jonathan and sandy are successful in their professions and boring with their mates. now, jonathan has a relationship with the sexy bobbie. as years goes by, the two friends have affairs with different women but no steady relationship.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil the film traces the sexual and emotional confusion of two men from their amherst college days in the fifties through the kennedy sixties, up to the vietnam era. jonathan, a successful tax attorney and sandy, a physician, personify two extremes of self-delusion and self-aggrandizement: jonathan makes the mistake of thinking sex is love, and embarks on a lifetime of sexual conquest; sandy dedicates himself to the pursuit of an idealized woman and the dreamy spiritual completeness to be found therein. in bobbie jonathan finds a partner whose masochism compliments his selfishness and emotional ambivalence. jonathan does not want her to hold a job, but neither does he like the fact that she spends all day in bed sleeping, or watching tv. sandy falls in love with his first college romance, susan; they marry and have children. but sandy is haunted by the fear that he was too hasty, even though he and susan lead a happy domestic life and strive to reinvigorate their sex life by making love "in all seven rooms" of their apartment. with jonathan's help, he enters into an affair with cindy, a tough professional woman who turns sandy off because she is too overbearing.        written by  alfiehitchie synopsis at amherst college in the late 1940s, freshmen roommates jonathan bates (jack nicholson) and sanford 'sandy' cohn (art garfunkle) develop a friendly rivalry over their attempts at "scoring" on their dates with female students...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page carnal knowledge storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users the best of jack nicholson  created 27 may 2011      iÌ‡ndir  created 28 aug 2011      milestone anti-censorship cases  created 21 jan 2012      mike nichols*  created 10 months ago      jack nicholson  created 1 week ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
