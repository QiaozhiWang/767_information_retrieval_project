summaries the chief spokesperson and lobbyist nick naylor is the vice-president of the academy of tobacco studies. he is talented in speaking and spins argument to defend the cigarette industry in the most difficult situations. his best friends are polly bailey that works in the moderation council in alcohol business, and bobby jay bliss of the gun business own advisory group safety. they frequently meet each other in a bar and they self-entitle the mod squad a.k.a. merchants of death, disputing which industry has killed more people. nick's greatest enemy is vermont's senator ortolan finistirre, who defends in the senate the use a skull and crossed bones in the cigarette packs. nick's son joey naylor lives with his mother, and has the chance to know his father in a business trip. when the ambitious reporter heather holloway betrays nick disclosing confidences he had in bed with her, his life turns upside-down. but nick is good in what he does for the mortgage.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil as a vice-president of the academy of tobacco studies, a washington tobacco lobby masquerading as research organization debunking the health risks of tobacco use, nick naylor, a born communicator, is the public face of the tobacco lobby. as the academy is funded by big tobacco, nick is able to use the "research" to spin the messages for tobacco and against anyone who is anti-tobacco. calling themselves the mod (merchants of death) squad, he often meets unofficially with his fellow lobbyists polly bailey and bobby jay bliss, who represent alcohol and firearms respectively, to discuss mutual strategies. as the biggest problem nick and the tobacco lobby faces is declining smoking rates among youth, nick comes up with a campaign to re-glamorize smoking in movies, which has the stumbling blocks of the highly public smoking-related health issues faced by former marlboro man, lorne lutch, and vermont senator ortolan finistirre who is pushing for mandatory poison labeling of tobacco products. nick hopes he can use his communication skills and charm to spin what looks to be an expose by washington probe reporter heather holloway in his favor. through all these machinations, nick is trying to reestablish a relationship with his preteen son, joey naylor, who lives with his mother and new stepfather. joey wants to understand what his father truly does for a living, while nick wants to set a good example for joey while still staying true to his own beliefs of what he does for a living.        written by  huggo tobacco industry lobbyist nick naylor has a seemingly impossible task: promoting cigarette smoking in a time when the health hazards of the activity have become too plain to ignore. nick, however, revels in his job, using argument and twisted logic to place, as often as not, his clients in the positions of either altruistic do-gooders or victims. nick's son joey needs to understand and respect his dad's philosophy, and nick works hard to respond to that need without compromising his lack of values. when a beautiful news reporter betrays nick's sexually-achieved trust, his world seems in danger of collapsing. but there's always one more coffin nail in nick's pack.        written by  jim beaver  jumblejim@prodigy.net satirical comedy follows the machinations of big tobacco's chief spokesman, nick naylor, who spins on behalf of cigarettes while trying to remain a role model for his twelve-year-old son.     written by  anonymous synopsis the film opens with nick naylor (aaron eckhart)
