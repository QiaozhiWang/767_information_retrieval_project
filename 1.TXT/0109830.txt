"forrest gump" is the story of a man who rose above his challenges, and who proved that determination, courage, and love are more important than ability.        written by  j. lake forrest gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, jenny curran, eludes him.     written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com synopsis the film begins with a feather falling to the feet of forrest gump who is sitting at a bus stop in savannah...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page forrest gump storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users already seen  created 02 feb 2012      seen it  created 15 apr 2012      25 movies that still makes my day  created 27 jul 2012      favourites  created 09 sep 2013      catching mara up to the 21st century  created 5 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
