rachael, his girlfriend, who had to decide whether to stay with him as they were just at point of taking their relationship to that next level or calling it quits when adam was first diagnosed; kyle, his spr colleague and best friend, who tries to cheer adam up by the positive, mostly in that adam can get laid by anyone he wants by playing the sympathy card (and in turn kyle can get his fair share riding on adam's coattails); alan lombardo and mitch barnett, two older fellow chemo patients who become the human faces of cancer to adam; and katherine mckay, a twenty-four year old ph.d. candidate who is assigned his psychological therapist, he who is only her third such patient which shows in her sometimes awkward but well meaning textbook actions.        written by  huggo inspired by a true story, a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.     written by  imdb editors synopsis adam learner (joseph gordon-levitt) is a 27-year-old journalist with an attractive girlfriend, rachael (bryce dallas howard)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page 50/50 storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users 2011 movies i've seen (ranked)  created 04 sep 2011      since started tft  created 23 nov 2011      movies i want to see.  created 02 jan 2012      films i want to watch  created 30 jan 2013      best movie ever (part 5)  created 12 oct 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
