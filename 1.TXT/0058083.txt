when a malfunction damages sac's fault indicator, the system is changed routinely, but it causes a malfunction in the mainframe that launches jack grady's squadron on an attack mission to obliterate moscow. when the full horror of the accidental attack order becomes clear, sac and the president must work to recall or stop the bombers, but all efforts are frustrated by the skill and working orders of the pilots involved as well as the power of their planes, and when they penetrate soviet airspace a running sky battle erupts. but the bombers press on, and through negotiations with the soviet premier, the president is left with but one hope of averting armageddon, an order so audacious it even shocks the soviet premier and leaves the president's subalters speechless.        written by  michael daly those in the pentagon war room are discussing the tactics, and the pros and cons of nuclear war with the soviets. in the room include professor groeteschele, the civilian adviser to the pentagon who has an academic's viewpoint, and brigadier general warren abraham "blackie" black. the general has been having a recurrent dream - that of a matador killing a bull - which he believes is some sort of omen relating to his job. through a series of mechanical, technical and human errors, american bombers are deployed to investigate a potential air threat. although the threat was non-existent, the bombers, through these errors, are ultimately sent to bomb moscow. because of counter-measures designed to protect orders, the bombers cannot be recalled. in addition to negotiations with the soviet premier, the president requests the advice of those in the war room on what to do, the individuals there having differing opinions. but the president will make his decisions based on that advice and his discussions with the premier. but those in mission control in omaha, who are removed from the discussion process but are charged with carrying out the orders, may have some issue with the president's orders since they are based on discussions with the "enemy".        written by  huggo american planes are sent to deliver a nuclear attack on moscow, but it's a mistake due to an electrical malfunction. can all-out war be averted?     written by  anonymous synopsis warren black lives in new york city and suffers a recurring nightmare about attending a bullfight that ends in a piercing shrieking noise...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page fail-safe storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users movies watched (january 2011)  created 01 apr 2011      classics  created 27 oct 2011      movies of my life - 1964  created 05 feb 2012      my 20th century favorites  created 11 nov 2013      top 50 b w classics  created 02 jul 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
