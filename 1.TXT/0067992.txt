       written by  rick munoz  rick.munoz@his.com adolescent charlie bucket is a good, hard working boy. his washerwoman mother is barely able to eke out a living to support charlie and charlie's bedridden grandparents grandma georgina, grandpa george, grandma josephine, and grandpa joe, the latter to whom charlie has a special bond. they live in the town where the mysterious, reclusive and genius willy wonka runs his chocolate factory. wonka has not been seen in years as he closed his factory to public access after his competitors, most specifically arthur slugworth, infiltrated the factory to steal his candy secrets. however, wonka is once again opening his factory, but only to five people and a guest apiece, each who will be given a lifetime supply of chocolate. those five will be those that find one of the five golden tickets hidden inside wonka chocolate bars. although charlie's chances of getting a golden ticket are remote at best - especially against a glutton, a spoiled peanut heiress, a gum fanatic and a television fanatic - charlie wants it more than anyone else and is the small dream which is keeping his spirit alive. those that eventually get the golden tickets will be exposed to all of wonka's magical secrets, the latest rumored to be that of the everlasting gobstopper, a candy that never gets smaller. but they will also be treated to an experience that some will hopefully learn from. and one will learn the real reason for wonka providing access to the factory. but if five are allowed access, others may also try to gain access, such as a devious slugworth, who will be ruined if the gobstopper hits the markets before he finds out its secret.        written by  huggo the world is agog when chocolate and candy maker willy wonka announces that 5 golden tickets granting access to his factory are to be found in his eponymous chocolate bar. for young charlie, getting hold of one of those tickets would be a dream come true. the family has little money but his grandpa joe encourages him to have faith and keep a positive attitude. the one chocolate bar he buys doesn't have a ticket but when he finds a dollar on the street and gets another, he strikes gold at last. the 5 children are admitted to the factory and find a wonderland of candies and chocolate. willie wonka tells them they can have anything they want - but he is definitely looking for something in return.        written by  garykmcd charlie bucket, a poor boy whose mother is barely able to support his family, is fortunate to be chosen as one of the 5 people to go inside the most popular and powerful chocolate factory in the world: the willy wonka chocolate factory. but a stranger, named arthur slugworth, tempts the kids to steal a piece of candy and give it to him. in exchange, he will make them rich. willy wonka, soon introduces them to the factory, and starts the grand tour around the factory. once inside, the 5 winners start to run amuck. one by one, the 5 kids start to disappear, until it is only charlie that remains. at this point, wonka starts to ignore charlie, and then tells him why: because charlie and grandpa joe, drank some forbidden product without permission. will charlie turn against wonka?
