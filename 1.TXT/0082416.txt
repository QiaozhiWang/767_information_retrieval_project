the decision made by director karel reisz and harold pinter was to frame fowles' basic plot within a "modern" context of their own making. while we watch as sarah (meryl streep), a 19th-century englishwoman ruined by an affair with a french lieutenant, enters into another disastrous relationship with principled young charles (jeremy irons), we are constantly made aware that what we're seeing is only a film. this is done by surrounding the story with a modern narrative, focusing on a movie production company which is on location--filming the french lieutenant's woman. meryl streep doubles in the role of sara and the american actress who plays her, while jeremy irons essays the dual role of charles and the handsome briton playing charles. likewise, everyone else in the cast is seen as "themselves" and as their french lieutenant's woman characters. not surprisingly, the "real" streep and irons enter into an affair which closely parallels their characters' relationship. the commercial tv version of french lieutenant's woman eliminates 30 minutes' worth of "extraneous" scenes. ~ hal erickson, rovi        written by  bob harren synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the french lieutenant's woman storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
