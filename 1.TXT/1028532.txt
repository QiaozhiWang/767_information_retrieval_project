"hachiko" or "eight," a lucky number. parker can't teach the dog to fetch, but the friend explains that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty. tragedy tests that loyalty.        written by  jhailey@hotmail.com eleven year old robbie is giving a oral class report on the topic of "my hero", his chosen subject, hachi, who on the surface is an unusual choice... several years earlier, parker wilson, who lives in bedridge in suburban new york city, is a college music/performing arts professor, he who makes the train commute to/from the city every working day. it is on one of those routine days going home that he finds at the bedridge station a puppy, who he eventually will learn was being shipped somewhere unknown, with the shipping tag lost. he also learns from ken, a japanese professor friend, that the dog is a japanese breed called an akita, and that the japanese character on the dog's collar tag is the number eight - "hachi". parker does whatever he can to find out who the dog belongs to, and although his many acquaintances around the train station do their small part in helping parker, no one is willing to take the dog, even temporarily. so parker takes the dog home, despite he and his wife cate long having dismissed the idea of having a dog. however parker is able to convince her to let the dog stay temporarily. eventually on the high probability that they will never find the dog's owner, cate, upon seeing the interaction between the two, lets parker permanently keep the dog, who he has since named hachi. although living in the wilson home with parker, cate and their daughter andy, hachi becomes not a wilson family pet, not cate's, not andy's, but parker's alone as a special bond forms between the two. although not a "typical" dog in that hachi will do not what most dogs do such as fetch, hachi demonstrates an unwavering and lifelong loyalty to parker in an unusual way that all around him can see. robbie chose hachi as his hero because of this loyalty, despite he never having met parker, his now deceased maternal grandfather.        written by  huggo hachi was a lost little dog at the station, but a man named parker wilson (richard gere) found him. at home, he cared for him all the time and learned him a lot things. but after a year, hacki is a smart dog, he often walk with parker to the station because he couldn't be without parker. hachi at the station always waiting for him to finish his job (he knows when he finish) and come to home with hachi. but for a moment, parker isn't returned anymore, it happened unbelievable about the dog hachi after he didn't returned. this movie will show you a strong feelings.        a college professor's bond with the abandoned dog he takes into his home.     written by  imdb editor synopsis this heartwarming true story is an american adaptation of a japanese tale about a loyal dog named hachiko...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page hachi: a dog's tale storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users recommended movies  created 09 aug 2011      movies u must see!!  created 07 apr 2013      movies that will touch ur heart ...  created 08 mar 2014      movie recommendations  created 08 jan 2015      coming soon  created 5 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
