       written by  anthony pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} based off of a short story. it is the near future, a future where murders have become so common, that a system had to be established. this system is called "precrime", where 3 psychics can predict murders before they happen. allowing police to stop the murders. this system is in production in washington d.c. where police officer john anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career. one day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder. now, he is running away from a system he helped become successful, and trying to find out why he was set up to commit murder.        written by  john wiggins in the year 2054, a so-called "pre-crime division" is working around washington, dc. its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. when the three precogs, who only work together, floating connected in a tank of fluid, have a vision, the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time it will happen, are given out to the special cops who then try to prevent the crime from happening. but there is a political dilemma: if someone is arrested before he commits a murder, can the person be accused of the murder, which - because of the arrest - never took place? the project of pre-crime, at the time being in a state of trial run, is going to be voted about in the near future. if people accept it, the crime rate is going to drop drastically, but it never will be known if there might not be too many people imprisoned, some or even all of them innocent. after john anderton lost his son to a crime a six years ago, he took up drugs, and works the precog division like nobody else. one day, his own name arrives in the "perpetrator" chute, and the precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. john takes off, his trust in the system diminishing rapidly. his own colleagues after him, john follows a very small trace that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called "minority report", a documentation of one of the rare events in which a precog sees something different than the other two.        written by  julian reischl  julianreischl@mac.com it is the year 2054 - washington d.c. - dreams can be recreated through computers, computer monitors and displays are transformed into holograms, and identification is done through eye-scanning. john anderton lost his son, and to prevent horrible events from occurring to other individuals he joins a unit known as "pre-crime" - where murderers are arrested before they can commit the murder. how does pre-crime work? through 3 people known as "precogs". they are 3 psychics used to see the future and they see murders exactly the way they will occur. through advanced technology, pre-crime officers are able to see what the precogs see, and they analyze the data, identify the perpetrator and victim, and try their best to stop the murder from occurring. the perpetrator is put into a sleep state with a device called a "halo". john anderton gets accused of murdering a man he has never even met, causing him to run from pre-crime and prove his innocence.        written by  demijan omeragic  nuh in a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder.     written by  skip4591 synopsis in washington, d.c. in the year 2054, john anderton (tom cruise) is head of a new police force called...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page minority report storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
