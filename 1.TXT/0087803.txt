part of the vast social caste known as the outer party, the rank and file of the sprawling apparatus of government. winston works in the records department of the ministry of truth - the section charged with modifying historical news archives for consistency. when by chance winston uncovers incontrovertible proof that the party is lying, he embarks on a journey of self-questioning. in doing so, he becomes a thought-criminal. winston begins to notice that a young party member, julia, is watching him. she wears the distinctive sash of the ultra-zealous anti sex league and winston fears that she is an informant. however, to his surprise, she reveals herself as a subversive and they embark on an illicit and dangerous relationship. this prompts winston to explore deeper the blur between propaganda and reality. ultimately, it leads him to o'brien - a member of the inner party who sets winston on an irreversible course of discovery.        written by  richard.leader@gmail.com in 1984, oceania is an omnipresent state ruled by the big brother with a totalitarian society and in permanent war, presently against eurasia, with intention of keeping the proletariat without education and possibility of capital accumulation. people from the upper classes follow the "ingsoc" philosophy and are under permanent surveillance of big brother through the "telescreen" - a monitor that is television and also spies the life of each individual. however, the proletariat is free of the control of the state. the party has just released the 10th edition of the newspeak dictionary, with the intention of reducing the words to make people be limited to express any feeling against the party. in the "minitrue" (ministry of truth in newspeak), the bureaucrat winston smith rewrites history to control the future of the party and is quite indifferent to his society. winston is approached by the party member o'brien that gives a copy of the new released dictionary to him. when winston meets the brother julia, they commit "sexcrime" and fall in love for each other. but they are captured by the fearful thought police and winston is interrogated and brainwashed by o'brien that explains the logic of the party to keep the power. but in the end, the human spirit prevails.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil george orwell's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to rebel by falling in love.     written by  anonymous synopsis set in a dystopian april 1984, nearly 40 years after the end of the second world war, and a few years after the so-called atomic wars...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page nineteen eighty-four storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users last works of great stars  created 11 aug 2011      to see  created 15 sep 2011      science fiction is contemporary  created 17 feb 2012      mit dir  created 27 sep 2012      well worth a watch  created 11 mar 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
