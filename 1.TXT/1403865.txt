"rooster" cogburn, a big old fellow with eye patch that has the grit to bring back criminals from the indian territory. mattie hires the drunken rooster and he plans to travel early in the morning with her. when mattie is ready to depart, she finds that the texas ranger laboeuf had visited rooster and proposed to share a huge reward for tom chaney in texas for the murder of a senator. laboeuf and rooster cross the river and mattie joins them, and the unlikely trio begins its dangerous journey seeking out tom chaney in the indian territory.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil forty year old spinster mattie ross tells the story of when she was fourteen in the late nineteenth century, living in yell county, arkansas. headstrong, willful, streetwise and stubborn, she felt she was best equipped between her mother and her younger brother to lead the charge to avenge the murder of her father, frank ross, by hired hand tom chaney while the two were in fort smith, arkansas to run errands, the murder occurring when tom was drunk. she learned that tom most likely joined lucky ned pepper's gang, had probably headed into the choctaw nation's territory, and that no one was after tom for the murder. believing she needed the assistance of a us marshal to carry out her mission, she decided, from the three suggested to her by the fort smith sheriff, to choose eye-patch adorned rueben "rooster" cogburn, the most ruthless of the bunch, he being a man who generally shot to kill first before asking questions - in other words, a man with true grit. she had certain regrets in choosing rooster if only because of his frequent take to drink. despite rooster's want to kill lucky ned, convincing him to take the job and to take her along - she insisting to ensure she got her money's worth - was more difficult than she had hoped. another problem in mattie getting what she believed was true justice was a texas ranger named leboeuf, who was also after tom, but for the murder of a texas senator. if leboeuf got to tom first, leboeuf would take him back to texas to stand trial for that murder, instead of tom paying for the murder of her father.        written by  huggo a tough u.s. marshal helps a stubborn teenager track down her father's murderer.     written by  anonymous synopsis mattie ross (hailee steinfeld), a 14-year-old from yell county, arkansas, is determined to avenge the murder of her father...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page true grit storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users vistos  created 04 sep 2011      2010  created 24 oct 2012      the best movies in 2010  created 22 mar 2014      2014  created 29 may 2014      faroeste  created 3 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
