orally and in writing - but then pleads not guilty and opts to defend himself in court. the young da assigned to the case, willy beachum, has had a successful career with a 97% conviction rate. beachum however is actually on his way to a lucrative position in a big private law firm, but his desire to win keeps him on the case. what ensues is a battle of wits between the two as crawford systematically destroys his opponents case.        written by  garykmcd in los angeles, the structural engineer ted crawford witnesses his wife jennifer crawford and her lover lieutenant robert 'rob' nunally in the swimming pool of a hotel. when jennifer comes back home, he shoots her on the head and then he shoots three times against the windows. the gardener ciro calls the police and the negotiator rob, who does not know the last name of his lover, gets the murder weapon and a confession from ted. meanwhile, the young and efficient but arrogant prosecutor willy beachum is resigning his position in the low-pay public service work to join the private civil-law firm wooton sims but decides to accept the case, which is his assessment is easily resolved. ted asks the judge to represent himself in court and willy accepts. but sooner the winner willy learns that the evidences can not be accepted in the trial and despite knowing that ted is the killer, the murder weapon is missing and he needs to get new evidences otherwise he will lose the case and ted will be a free man.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil lapd detective lt. rob nunally leads a squad investigating reported gunshots at the home of the wealthy crawfords, husband and wife ted and jennifer. nunally enters the house facing ted holding a gun, he confessing to shooting jennifer, who is lying unconscious or dead in a pool of her own blood a short distance away from him. as the police take ted into custody, the police station where he will subsequently sign a written confession as to having shot jennifer, other first responders find that jennifer is still alive, although the eventual diagnosis is that, pending a miracle, she will not ever awaken from her coma, thus being placed on life support. the case is assigned to ambitious young deputy district attorney, willy beachum. despite being a good lawyer, willy has thus far scripted his own success - a 97% conviction rate - achieved somewhat by handing over unwinnable cases to other ddas. this case will be his last in the da's office as he has been hired by prestigious private firm, wooton sims. this move of being hired by a private firm is much quicker than most of willy's predecessors and colleagues in the da's office, again achieved partly on a calculated action on his part. although willy is unsure if he will see this case through to its conclusion, he is tasked to do so as the case looks to be concluded before he is scheduled to be at wooton sims. with ted having made the verbal and written confessions and with ted declining legal counsel in favor of acting as his own lawyer, willy sees this case as a slam dunk in his favor despite one small hiccup regarding the supposed murder weapon. despite ted's seemingly crazy behavior, willy will soon learn that ted has a grand plan to win the case involving nunally. as the case progresses, willy has to decide how far he will go to get that conviction - it almost becoming a personal vendetta against ted - losing which may not only threaten his new job at wooton sims, but his career as a lawyer, that is unless he can find that much needed evidence to put ted away legitimately.        written by  huggo an attorney, intent on climbing the career ladder toward success, finds an unlikely opponent in a manipulative criminal he is trying to prosecute.     written by  mystic80 synopsis theodore "ted" crawford (anthony hopkins), a wealthy and talented structural engineer, discovers his wife jennifer (embeth davidtz) is having an affair with police detective rob nunally (billy burke)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page fracture storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users en mis clases de derecho me dijeron...  created 10 aug 2012      best drama  created 28 nov 2012      all time favorites  created 08 oct 2013      shocking/unexpected/unique endings  created 10 aug 2014      movies i really like  created 6 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
