summaries kym buchman has been in drug rehab for nine months, during which time she has been clean. she is released temporarily from the facility to attend her sister rachel buchman's wedding. during her release, kym is staying at the family home, where the wedding is taking place. as such, it is like grand central station for the duration of kym's stay, which may not be the most conducive situation for her in constantly being exposed to the watching eyes of those who know and don't yet know her, but know of her situation. the reunion with her family members starts off well enough, but issues around kym's release from rehab quickly surface. kym and rachel's father, paul buchman, wants to make sure that kym is all right at all times, which to kym feels instead like he doesn't trust her. rachel slowly begins to resent kym's situation taking over what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life, some of which is directed by kym, some of which isn't. one person present but largely not included in the last minute wedding planning work is kym and rachel's mother, abby, from who paul is divorced. the two have since married other people. outwardly, abby has been nurturing of kym throughout her life. however, what is one of the key moments in kym's drug induced life, and in their collective family's lives, may profoundly affect the wedding. beyond how kym's presence affects the wedding, the goings-on of the family during kym's short stay may either bring them closer together or tear them apart.        written by  huggo kym is released from rehab for a few days so she can go home to attend her sister rachel's wedding. the home environment is always challenging for a recovering addict, no less so when the visit is only for a few days. while the sisters feel genuine affection for one another, there is tension in their relationship. rachel feels that her father dotes on kym far too much and kym is upset to learn that rachel has selected a friend to be her maid of honor. their father is genuinely concerned about kym's well-being but doesn't see the stress the relationship is causing. both women also have to deal with their selfish mother who is clearly more concerned with her own well-being ahead of that of her children. underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred many years previously and for which kym is held by some to be responsible.        written by  garykmcd rachel and sidney decide to get married, and rachel's friend, emma, is to be the maid of honor. arrangements for a traditional indian service are made. however, much to emma's chagrin, she is replaced by kym, rachel's substance-abusing sister who appears shortly before the engagement. it is on the day of the formal engagement that rachel and the rest of the family will realize that involving kym may have been a huge mistake, the past will be re-visited and skeletons will start surfacing from hitherto closed and forgotten closets.        written by
