plot summary showing all 2 plot summaries in the 1930's, max brown is an urban young man from an eastern province, fresh from college, whose only job offer is in a one-room school house in the canadian prairie. at first he's distant, superior, lonely, and bewildered; his students are rebellious. over the course of the year, he is drawn to alice field, the wife of a farmer, in a love that can lead nowhere. but, he and his students connect, a connection that matters and lasts.        written by  jhailey@hotmail.com it's the winter of 1935 and max brown is newly arrived in willowgreen, saskatchewan - a rural canadian prairie town - on his first teaching job in a one room schoolhouse. he quickly realizes that this is not his dream situation: the winter is harsher than he's ever experienced, he's living in the basement of the school, the older of his students treat him poorly and his wages are paltry if and when he ever does get paid. he also feels physically and emotionally isolated. he would leave this position but he doesn't have the finances to do so. there, he bonds primarily with two townsfolk. harris montgomery sees max as an obvious choice to espouse the politics of socialism. and alice field sees in max a person like herself: being a british war bride, she is an alien in a harsh environment. alice is in an unsatisfying marriage and turns to max for emotional support. as max goes through his first year in willowgreen, he learns to understand life in a rural prairie town, both from the viewpoint of his students and for his own benefit.        written by  huggo synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page why shoot the teacher?
