all 3 plot summaries in yet another attempt to get together with kimmy burton, nitz promises to help her organize the annual spring fling carnival which features a concert by good charlotte and a "news report" by mtv's carson daly. however, gimpy coercers him into playing one of their usual all-day/all-night game of risk, which he thinks jessie will help get him out of... until she realizes how well nitz is doing, and decides to help him win the game, while all hell breaks loose at the carnival.        written by  daniel timothy dey nitz and jessie are going out to get some free ben  jerry's ice cream but they run into kimmy burton, a girl that he's had a crush on since grade school. nitz lies to kimmy about going to the spring fling and volunteers to run the popcorn booth at 12:00 the next day. gimpy calls up nitz and asks him to come over to his dorm room for a game of risk. nitz, however, declines to come over to gimpy's dorm room but then agrees to it as long as he's allowed to leave the game at 12:00 the next day. with that gimpy, cal, and rocko devise an elaborate scheme that will ensure that nitz stays for the remainder of the game. meanwhile jessie is infuriated by the fact that nitz's brain turns to mush every time he runs into kimmy and the fact that when his brain turns to mush he does everything and anything kimmy asks him to do. nitz comes up to jessie and asks her to bail him out of the game because he doesn't trust that gimpy will let him leave by 12:00. the game gets underway with cal, gimpy, and rocko devising their plan to get nitz to stay until the game is finished. they go over the rules that they play by and the game gets started. nitz starts out by noticing that the clock on gimpy's wall has stopped. his men are in control of everything in gimpy's room. they keep on playing until rocko is the first one out. leaving just gimpy, cal, and nitz to play the game. jessie finally enters to save nitz by making up a story about how the president needs a blood transfusion. jessie then gets into the game. kimmy is upset that things at the spring fling are not going right with all of the rioting and the people not being stamped properly but things only get worse when the popcorn booth catches fire. kimmy tries to stop the festivities but everyone is having such a good time that she sees no reason to stop it. it isn't until much later that nitz realizes that gimpy's been cheating the whole time they've been playing. he threatens to get up only to find that the entire "click" was in on the attempt to get him to stay. the "click" complains that every time they want to play risk nitz has something else that he wants to do. nitz then complains that he's tired of arguing with people who are supposed to be his friends all the time. then rocko states that he's tired of people yelling at him like at his school. gimpy then tells rocko that he alienates people and that his alienation would stop if he would just stop drinking and smashing stuff. then the others start to argue about the way they're being treated and then cal complains about how it's annoying to have a boogie stuck up his nose. nitz beats gimpy which causes him to go into a kamakaze resulting in his killing himself. nitz then complains that gimpy's kamikaze cause his troops to be spread so thin that the only person who could win would be cal. in the end everyone who likes cal is relieved to see him again and nitz and jessie realize that they haven't missed very much.        written by  blackarachnia 2 gimpy, cal, and rocko all devise
