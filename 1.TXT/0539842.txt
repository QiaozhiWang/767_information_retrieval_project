question, diane, who still has feelings for sam, tries one last ditch attempt to get some sort of commitment from him by calling him at cheers. without directly asking for that commitment, diane tells sam of frasier's proposal. sam is unable to give diane that commitment since he believes she called just to gloat about her happiness. so diane accepts frasier's proposal. in the sober realization of the post telephone call, sam thinks that he made a big mistake by not telling diane not to marry frasier. he impulsively decides to fly to florence to stop the wedding. however, a piece of new
