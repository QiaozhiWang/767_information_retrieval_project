and driver max von mayerling. norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. norma proposes joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. when joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer betty schaefer, norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil desperate for cash, screenwriter joe gillis has a chance meeting with a faded silent film star. norma desmond lives in her crumbling sunset boulevard mansion with only her butler to keep her

a symbol to him of independence, which is threatened to be repossessed due to he being behind in payments. in eluding the repossessors, joe stumbles onto the decaying sunset boulevard mansion of fifty year old faded silent movie star norma desmond, who has largely been forgotten by the movie going public. the only other person besides norma living at the mansion is norma's valet, max, whose unofficial job is to prime norma's fragile but larger than life ego. it is somewhat due to max's lies about the public still clamoring for her that a delusional norma is working toward her return to
