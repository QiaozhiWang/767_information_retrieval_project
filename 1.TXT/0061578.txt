to parachute behind enemy lines and cause havoc for the german generals at a rest house on the eve of d-day.        written by  john vogel  jlvogel@comcast.net us army major john reisman, based in london, is an inventive man who often thinks outside the box which causes many problems in the structured military. but it is because of this mentality that in march 1944, he is assigned, or as his superiors put it volunteers for a near suicide mission. prior to the allied forces invading continental europe, he and his team, who he will train personally with sergeant bowren as his second in command, will infiltrate a highly fortified and guarded french ch√¢teau being used by the nazis as respite house and meeting place primarily for high ranking german officers, kill as many of the officers as possible and take out the communications tower. his squad will consist of twelve of the most heavily sentenced gi convicts, many whose sentence is death. reisman, who doesn't like the assignment because of the involvement of the convicts, adds one caveat to doing this job: that the convicts have their sentences commuted if they survive. reisman quickly learns that besides a resentment to authority, the twelve convicts are a disparate group, each with their own button issues and motivations. reisman not only has to get them to cooperate, but work as a team, which includes having a zero tolerance policy for the group as a whole on issues such as escape attempts while under his command. even if he can achieve these goals, reisman also faces the obstacle of colonel everett breed, who is the antithesis of reisman and who will be at the parachute training base at the same time as reisman's squad, for which breed has disdain.        written by  huggo it is 1944 and the allied armies stand ready for a major invasion of germany from bases in england. as a prelude to d-day, us army intelligence orders a top secret mission where convicted criminals will be offered a pardon in return for parachuting into the reich on a suicide mission.        written by  anthony hughes  husnock31@hotmail.com an army major who likes to butt heads with his superiors, is being "given" a new assignment, to train 12 men who are either sentenced to death or life imprisonment, to go behind enemy lines raid a chateau that the germans are using as an r center and kill as enemy officers as they can and disrupt the german chain of command. now he not only has to train them; he has to get them to start acting like a unit. and when a colonel whom the major has been having the most trouble with reports to the generals that his unit is not working out, the major asks the general to try them out by having them participate in a war game. if they don't succeed they will be sent back to prison to face their sentences.        written by  rcs0411@yahoo.com in late march 1944 a rebellious us army major is "volunteered" to train twelve convicted military criminals for a suicide mission - to parachute to a heavily-guarded nazi general staff officers' retreat to try and assassinate german officers on leave. to get his unorthodox assignment done the major must convince army brass to grant pardons to the men, then try to mold the twelve recidivists into a functioning unit, a task made more daunting by the doubts of a by-the-book general and by the suicidal nature of the mission.        written by  michael daly a us army major is assigned a dozen convicted murderers to train and lead them into a mass assassination mission of german officers in world war ii.     written by  kenneth chisholm synopsis wwii army major reisman ( ) has a history of bucking authority, including that of his former commander col...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the dirty dozen storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users indispensable best war movies  created 25 nov 2010      oldies but goodies  created 18 apr 2013      the best war films  created 26 aug 2014      60s  created 23 oct 2014      monarch theater  created 4 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
