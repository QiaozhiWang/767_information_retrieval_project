"hustler" magazine brings the flynts not only millions in profit but also the wrath of "decent" people. flynt and his overburdened attorney find themselves in courtrooms all over the nation defending larry against criminal and civil charges. in the meantime, flynt is beset by paralysis, the result of an assassination attempt, drug addiction, mental illness, and althea's failing health.        written by  allen brown  browna@ohsu.edu the life and times of "an unseemly man," larry flynt, publisher of hustler magazine. this movie's got it all: from his humble beginnings selling moonshine, to his multi-million dollar publishing empire. along the way he gets shot and paralysed, imprisoned, and taken to court thanks to his nemesis jerry falwell.        written by  kevin gillease  gillease@scf-fs.usc.edu a partially idealized film of the controversial pornography publisher and how he became a defender of free speech for all people.     written by  kenneth chisholm synopsis in 1953, 10-year-old larry flynt is selling moonshine in kentucky. twenty years later, flynt (woody harrelson) and his younger brother...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the people vs. larry flynt storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users movies i've seen 11/11/11  created 11 nov 2011      the best biography movies  created 18 jan 2012      1996  created 26 aug 2014      top 25 true story movies  created 28 apr 2015      trials  created 4 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
