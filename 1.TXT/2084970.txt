facing alongside an inner conflict that plays the most decisive role in his life.        written by  aanchal vashisht out in the world, one who is compelled to create is considered abnormal. society is hard on the non-conformist. a creator may solve impossible puzzles with his brain or write symphony; he turns nothing into something. success in his endeavor may result in the masses of society clustering at the median to call him "genius." but, beware: this means they can neither understand the achievement nor hope to equal the mind who made it. the same masses who eagerly accept his gifts with the one hand will turn around and push him into a snake pit with the other. such is the cautionary tale of alan mathison turing, master of the puzzle and father of the modern computer.        written by  la-lawyer during world war ii, mathematician alan turing tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians.     written by  huskybeagle2001 synopsis based on a true story. we hear alan turing saying, "are you paying attention? good. if you're not listening carefully...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the imitation game storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users james  created 25 jan 2014      next to see  created 29 jul 2014      seen in march 2015  created 01 mar 2015      2014 top watch list  created 11 months ago      british movies  created 1 month ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
