if one tunnel is found, they can focus on the others. each escapee will be provided with a complete set of forged documents and standard clothing. with their reputations preceding them, each pow is assigned a specific task in carrying out the plan. somewhat outside of the plot are captain hilts and flying officer ives - who spent their first thirty days in camp in the cooler together - they who are unofficially assigned as the decoys who will make more rudimentary escape attempts. they ask hilts to make a more serious task of reconnaissance of the local town if he ever does successfully escape, which of course means his recapture to bring the information back into camp and more time in the cooler. beyond basic logistical problems and the germans finding out what's going on, they have potential problems in certain pows who may become liabilities dealing with their own personal issues.        written by  huggo the nazis, exasperated at the number of escapes from their prison camps by a relatively small number of allied prisoners, relocates them to a high-security "escape-proof" camp to sit out the remainder of the war. undaunted, the prisoners plan one of the most ambitious escape attempts of world war ii. based on a true story.        written by  kevin ackley  kackley1@aol.com based on a true story, "the great escape" deals with the largest allied escape attempt from a german pow camp during the second world war. the first part of the film focuses on the escape efforts within the camp and the process of secretly digging an escape tunnel. the second half of the film deals with the massive effort by the german gestapo to track down the over 70 escaped prisoners who are at this point throughout the third reich attempting to make their way to england and various neutral countries.        written by  anthony hughes  husnock31@hotmail.com allied p.o.w.s plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a german camp during world war ii.     written by  chris white synopsis in 1944, the germans have built a special stalag, or prison camp, designed to house their most troublesome inmates...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the great escape storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users phreekshow's do you have a death wish?  created 23 dec 2010      top movies 1  created 11 jun 2011      great movies i have seen so far.. vol. 4  created 03 sep 2013      prison drama  created 29 jan 2015      the movies i watched  created 20 mar 2015      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
