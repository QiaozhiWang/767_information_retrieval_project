further, she leaves three sealed envelopes addressed to the twins' father that they believed had died in the middle east; to their unknown brother; and the last one to themselves to be opened only after the delivery of the other two. then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother. she travels to the middle east to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to canada. she feels disturbed with the revelations and asks simon to come to the middle east to assist her in her journey. simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil twins journey to the middle east to discover their family history, and fulfill their mother's last wishes.     written by  anonymous synopsis after their mother succumbs to a stroke she suffers at a community swimming pool, twin brother and sister receive final requests in their immigrant mother's will...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page incendies storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users great movies i have seen so far.. vol. 4  created 03 sep 2013      my best movies of the '10s - so far...!  created 16 dec 2013      good ones  created 12 feb 2014      my favourite movies  created 6 months ago      seen in 2016  created 2 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
