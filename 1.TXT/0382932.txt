will he be able to please everyone in his locality?        written by  gavin (gunmasterm@hotmail.com) a rat who can cook makes an unusual alliance with a young kitchen worker at a famous restaurant.     written by  anonymous synopsis the movie opens with a tv show featuring chef auguste gusteau (brad garrett), owner of the best restaurant in paris...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page ratatouille storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know?
