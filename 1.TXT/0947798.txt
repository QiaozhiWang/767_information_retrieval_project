a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.        written by  fox searchlight pictures thomas leroy, the artistic director of a new york city ballet company, is mounting swan lake as the company's next production. many of the ballerinas in the company aspire for the lead, which would have previously gone to the company's former principle dancer beth macintyre before her forced retirement. no one wants the the role more than nina sayers, who lives to dance, so much so that she wants to be exactly like beth in every aspect. nina lives with her overbearing mother, erica sayers, a former ballerina who now lives vicariously through her daughter as she never made it as a ballerina herself. nina is a technically proficient and hard working dancer who can easily capture the essence of the innocent white swan, but thomas doesn't believe she has the dark passion required to portray the black swan. an unexpected move by nina convinces thomas that nina may have what it takes, and he gives her the lead. thomas will do anything to get that passion out of her. nina feels that her new place in the company is threatened by lily, a ballerina newly arrived into the company from san francisco. lily, who is looser in every aspect of her life than nina, encompasses the essence of the black swan more so than nina. but as nina believes lily is to her what she herself was to beth, nina, in doing whatever it takes to be perfect as both the white swan and the black swan, descends into madness.        written by  huggo nina sayers is a dancers with a new york city ballet company. she is dedicated to her art and her craft but lacks confidence. she is also pressed on by her domineering mother, also a ballerina in her youth, who gave up dancing when she got pregnant with nina. nina seems to achieve her goal when the company's artistic director thomas leroy selects her as the lead in their new production of swan lake. leroy is honest however in telling her that while he has no doubt she can handle the role of the white swan, he's not sure she can handle the role of the black swan. adding to her self-doubts is the arrival of a new dancer, lily, who seems ideally suited to playing the black swan. to succeed, nina will will have to transform herself into something she has never been.        written by  garykmcd a committed dancer wins the lead role in a production of tchaikovsky's "swan lake" only to find herself struggling to maintain her sanity.     written by  noah orent synopsis the movie opens as nina sayers (natalie portman), a young ballerina in her mid twenties, is dancing the prologue to swan lake...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page black swan storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users good films i've seen  created 10 oct 2011      the great ones  created 02 dec 2011      best movie for ever  created 16 nov 2013      best movie ever (part 5)  created 12 oct 2014      mindfull of memories  created 9 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
