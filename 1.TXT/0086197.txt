mach 1 - with pilots in the newly commissioned us air force at edwards air force base in california primarily those attempting the feat, many who will die in the process. but with what is happening in the soviet union will accelerate the american space program, which will largely usurp the political and public consciousness on those aeronautic feats. however, many within the space program and many pilots downgrade the importance of "man behind the wheel" in getting into space. regardless, many pilots apply for the seven positions within the first american space program - mercury - the seven chosen who do whatever they can to make flying expertise an important aspect of the job. in all these situations, the support from the women behind the men is demonstrated, they who have the continual fact of one in four not making it back from a flight in the front of their minds. the motivations of the individuals comprising the pilots, the astronauts and the wives are also shown.        written by  huggo the story of the original mercury 7 astronauts and their macho, seat-of-the-pants approach to the space program.     written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com synopsis in 1947, a group of determined men gathered at a remote air force base in the high desert of california...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the right stuff storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users 1983 films  created 16 feb 2012      movies with astronauts  created 16 may 2013      aviação  created 11 aug 2013      resolution movies  created 25 feb 2015      lvti history department movie wish list  created 3 weeks ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
