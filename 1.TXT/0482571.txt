which as time passes makes their friends and loved ones get away from them and little-by-little destroys their lives until they eventually succeed to preform the trick- each by a very different way.        written by  j. s. golden in victorian london, illusionist alfred borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist robert angier. borden's indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of john cutter, who saw borden backstage in the area where angier was killed. at the end of one of his shows, angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which is a prop for one of angier's tricks performed earlier in the show. angier ended up drowning as the tank was locked after he fell into it. borden, angier and cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive. early in their magic careers, both borden and angier worked under "milton the magician", while angier's wife julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and cutter as his ing√©nieur - staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required - work that he still does for others. based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both borden and angier striking out creating their own shows and they having a feud which was not only in the professional realm but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. while borden is arguably more accomplished in the technical aspects of the illusions, angier is the more accomplished showman. in the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching the shot bullet trick, and more so the transported man trick. in the process of their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. the question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the other.        written by  huggo a mysterious story of two magicians whose intense rivalry leads them on a life-long battle for supremacy -- full of obsession, deceit and jealousy with dangerous and deadly consequences. from the time that they first met as young magicians on the rise, robert angier and alfred borden were competitors. however, their friendly competition evolves into a bitter rivalry making them fierce enemies-for-life and consequently jeopardizing the lives of everyone around them. set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century london.        written by  ropeofsilicone.com two stage magicians engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion.     written by  anonymous synopsis the prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest. cutter ( )...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the prestige storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users year - 2006  created 03 sep 2011      the great ones  created 02 dec 2011      february watchlist  created 24 jan 2013      mindfull of memories  created 9 months ago      catching mara up to the 21st century  created 5 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
