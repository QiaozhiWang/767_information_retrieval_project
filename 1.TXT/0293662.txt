but when frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. violating rule three, frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken.        written by  anthony pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} ex-special forces operator frank martin lives what seems to be a quiet life along the french mediterranean, hiring himself out as a mercenary "transporter" who moves goods - human or otherwise - from one place to another. no questions asked. frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. he has been hired by an american known only as "wall street" (see rule two) to make a delivery, but when frank stops along route, he notices his "package" is moving. violating his own personal rules, frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman.        written by  anonymous frank martin is a former soldier now living a solitary existence in france, frank runs a private business as a "transporter" a hired criminal whose job is to transport cargo, packages and passengers without question. playing by the rules, frank is the best in the business and he has never broken the rules. until, frank is hired by an american criminal known as "wall street" to deliver a package. frank's curiosity leads him to break the rules, and he discovers the package he is delivering to wall street is a chinese woman named lai. learning that frank broke the rules and learn about lai, wall street sends his mercenaries to assassinate him. with his own life in danger, frank takes it upon himself to protect not only himself, but lai, as he agrees to help lai rescue enslaved people from china, who are being smuggled into france by wall street helped by lai's father.        written by  daniel williamson frank is hired to "transport" packages for unknown clients and has made a very good living doing so. but when asked to move a package that begins moving, complications arise.     written by  matt sheppard synopsis frank martin (jason statham) is a highly skilled driver known only as "the transporter." the titular character is a former special forces officer who...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page the transporter storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users every film i have saw  created 19 feb 2012      must see list  created 03 aug 2012      favorite movies  created 13 may 2013      king  created 7 months ago      ranking 2002 films  created 1 month ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
