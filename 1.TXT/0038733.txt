amazed at his resilience in the face of death. miraculously, he wakes up on the beach with a headache and not much else. he meets june and they immediately fall in love. there has been a mistake however. he was supposed to die but was missed by the heavenly messenger who was to collect him due to a particularly thick english fog. when the messenger calls on him to accompany him to the great beyond, he demands the opportunity to defend himself and argue that as a result of the mistake, he has now fallen in love and should be allowed to live out his life and remain on earth.        written
