christina will make up some ruse for michel to come to niort; they will drug and then drown him in nicole's bathtub; they will then transport the body back to the school before the end of the weekend, dumping the body into the school's murky outdoor pool; the dead body will eventually rise to the surface and thus be discovered. with the successful execution of the plan, nicole and christina will have an alibi of being away for the weekend when he would have died by accidentally drowning in the pool. with a few required modifications and a few hiccups along the way, the latter largely due to christina often losing her nerve, they are able to carry out the plan successfully... or so they believe. however, the body never materializes in the pool, even after the pool is emptied on a pretense. other strange things happen with regard to a missing michel which belie what nicole and christina believe to be reality. did someone discover what they did, take the body and will eventually try to blackmail them? is michel still alive and just playing with them? are their minds playing tricks on them? or is there another reason they just have not thought about as a possibility?        written by  huggo the wife of a cruel headmaster and his mistress conspire to kill him, but after the murder is committed, his body disappears, and strange events begin to plague the two women.     written by  anonymous synopsis the story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean michel delassalle (meurisse)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page diabolique storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users top horror films  created 10 oct 2012      mystery  created 04 apr 2013      korku - gerilim  created 19 aug 2014      25 great psychological thrillers that are worth your time  created 19 nov 2014      mon top ann√©es 50  created 02 feb 2015      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
