the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined earth. secretary delacourt, a government official, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of elysium. that doesn't stop the people of earth from trying to get in by any means they can. when unlucky max is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that, if successful, will not only save his life but could bring equality to these polarized worlds.        written by  production in 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people live on the exhausted earth. in los angeles, the former car thief max da costa is on parole and works in an unhealthy factory armadyne managed by the ceo john carlyle. he dreams of saving money to travel to elysium. meanwhile the secretary of defense of elysium, delacourt, plots a coup d'etat against president patel, with the support of carlyle. he programs a software that can override elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to delacourt. carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection. max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in armadyne and has only five more days of life. he seeks out the criminal spider expecting to travel to elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. spider tells that if max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of carlyle that is on earth. max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in carlyle's brain. when delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent kruger to hunt down max and recover the software at any cost.
