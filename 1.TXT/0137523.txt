flight home. tyler seems to be everything that he's not and together they create a men-only group for bare knuckle fighting. it soon becomes all the rage with fight clubs springing up across the country and the group itself becoming an anti-capitalist domestic terrorist organization. tyler and maria develop a relationship leaving him often on the outside of what is going on. he soon finds that the group is out of control and after a major self-revelation decides there is only one way out.        written by  garykmcd an insomniac unnamed narrator needs a fantasy to escape from his deadly boring life, he tries joining a cancer support group however the only thing they do in the group is cry into each others chest, but then he is on a plane on his way back from what a viewer would assume is a business trip our unnamed narrator encounters tyler durden, a soap selling badass who happens to run a secret fight club in the diner parking lot with his friend who follows 8 simple rules set out by tyler, our unnamed narrator of course is taken into this scheme ran by tyler...        a young urban professional who works for a major car manufacturer can't sleep. although he doesn't have any of the associated afflictions, he stumbles across support groups as a means to let out whatever emotions he is feeling, which in turn allows him to sleep. but the use of these support groups is ruined when he meets a young woman named marla singer, who is also going to all these support group meetings. because he knows she too is not afflicted with any of the maladies for which the groups exist, her presence has lessened the impact of the stories he hears. his life changes when he meets a soap manufacturer named tyler durden, who in many ways is the antithesis of the insomniac. due to unusual circumstances with his own condo, the insomniac moves in with tyler, who lives in a large dilapidated house in an otherwise abandoned part of town. after a bit of spontaneous roughhousing with tyler in a bar parking lot, the insomniac finds it becomes a ritual between the two of them, which helps him cope with the other more difficult aspects of his life. the fights also attract a following, others who not only want to watch but join in. understanding that there are other men like them, the insomniac and tyler begin a secret fight club. as the fight club's popularity grows, so does its scope in all aspects. marla becomes a circle not specifically of the fight clubs but of tyler and the insomniac's collectives lives. as the nature of the fight clubs becomes out of control in the insomniac's view, the insomniac's life, in association, is one where he no longer understands what is happening around him, or how he can get out of it without harming himself.        written by  huggo an insomniac office worker, looking for a way to change his life, crosses paths with a devil-may-care soap maker, forming an underground fight club that evolves into something much,
