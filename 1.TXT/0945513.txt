reluctant in that he still believes he should be in afghanistan - he tries to find out the underlying reason for the project, since he will learn that all aboard the train have died and will regardless, and why he was chosen for the project. as he finds out more and more, he has his own missions which may be contrary to what goodwin and the project's architect, rutledge, have in mind.        written by  huggo a soldier wakes up in someone else's body and discovers he's part of an experimental government program to find the bomber of a commuter train. a mission he has only 8 minutes to complete.     written by  tim wakeman synopsis a man (jake gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train sitting across from a woman named christina warren (michelle monaghan)...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page source code storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users 2011 movies i've seen (ranked)  created 04 sep 2011      sci-fi  created 13 jan 2013      hay que ver  created 20 sep 2013      my best movies of the '10s -
