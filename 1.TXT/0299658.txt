after discovering their affair), roxie meets fred cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. however after roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and fred has had his wicked way with her, he reveals that he has no more connections in showbusiness than she does. this is the final straw for roxie, and her constant anger at rejection explodes. she shoots fred cassely and kills him. upon discovering her infidelity, roxie's husband amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and roxie is sent to jail, pending hanging. in jail she finally meets tabloid darling velma kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale. sharing the clink with velma, are a collection of other sly females, all awaiting trial for the murders of their own partners. velma is aloof to roxie, however the prison warden mrs morton offers roxie the opportunity of representation by slick chicago lawyer billy flynn. billy is more a showbiz p. r agent than a legal lawyer and minipulates the tabloids into thinking roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. the tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block, and roxie finally becomes a star. however due to roxie's new found fame, velma is forgotten about. she is forced to approach roxie with an offer of a part in her vaudville act (filling the gap left by her murdered sister), but roxie turns down her offer flat, thinking she needs no support in topping the bill. however, just as velma's star fell, so does roxie's, when go-to-hell kitty arrives at the jail on a multiple murder charge, the press forget roxie and now she and velma are in the same boat. with one more trick up her sleave roxie manages to bring the media attention back onto her, and her day in court arrives. billy is now ready to play the ultimate showman!        written by  anonymous velma kelly is the sexy vaudeville star who murders her husband and sister after finding them in bed together. roxie is the wannabe vaudeville star who kills her lover after finding out he was never going to make her famous. enter billy flynn, the greasy lawyer whose goal is not only to have his clients acquitted, but to make them legal legends. billy, who apparently likes roxie's angle (he tried to kill me) better than velma's (i blacked out and can't remember a thing). with help from matron mama morton both women vie for the spot as illinois's most famed murderess, but there's only room for one legend... "that's chicago".        written by  tigerchick5655 roxie hart is a married chorus girl with hopes of being a headliner in vaudeville. velma kelly is a former headliner. what do these two have in common? they both are murderesses. roxie killed her lover when he walked out on her, and velma killed her husband and sister, who were having an affair. chicago's newspapers love the nitty-gritty and velma is at the top of the headlines. but then roxie comes along and velma is old news. they find themselves competing for not only the press' attention, but also the focus of their shared lawyer, the suave billy flynn. add to the mix a sob sister, roxie's hapless husband amos, and a warm prison matron who watches out for her girls (if there's something in it for her), and you have chicago.        written by  ted zoldan murderesses velma kelly and roxie hart find themselves on death row together and fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows in 1920s chicago.     written by  macheath synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page chicago storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users some of my favorite films :)  created 08 jul 2011      bad movies you must avoid  created 26 nov 2011      musicales  created 18 may 2012      musicals!  created 31 oct 2013      musicals  created 16 apr 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
