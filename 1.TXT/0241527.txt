a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry. harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by hagrid, the grounds keeper for hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. famous for an incident that happened at his birth, harry makes friends easily at his new school. he soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.        written by  carly harry potter is an average bespectacled 11 year old boy who has lived with the dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. for some reason the family has always mistreated him. on his 11th birthday a giant man named rubeus hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. he embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends ron weasley and hermione granger along the way. they soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.        written by  soumitra harry potter thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his 11th birthday, but he is far from wrong. a giant named hagrid appears, and gives harry the all important news. he is a wizard. now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. ron weasley is not very brave friend and hermione is the smart friend. but not everything is quiet at hogwarts as harry suspects someone is planning to steal the sorcerer's stone.        written by  simon on his eleventh birthday, harry potter discovers that he is no ordinary boy. hagrid, a beetle-eyed giant, tells harry that he is a wizard and has a place at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. in his first year of magical education, harry tackles a fully grown mountain troll, learns to play quidditch, and participates in a thrilling "live" game of chess.        harry potter is a young boy with extraordinary magical abilities, after 11 miserable years with his relatives the dursley's, harry receives a letter from hogwarts, not knowing anything about his past, he must come face to face with difficult classes, ghoulish beasts, and an enemy that has tried to murder him since he was born.        young harry potter has to lead a hard life: his parents have died in a car crash when he was still a baby, and he is being brought up by his uncle vernon and aunt petunia. for some reason unbeknownst to the bespectacled ten-year-old, the dursleys let him live in the small chamber under the stairs, and treat him more like vermin than like a family member. his fat cousin dudley, the dursley's real son, keeps bothering harry all the time. on his eleventh birthday, harry potter finally receives a mysterious letter from a certain hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, telling him that he is chosen as one of the future students of that supposedly renowned school. hagrid, the gigantic man who brought the letter, finally introduces harry into the real circumstances of his life: his parents were a wizard and a witch, they were killed by the evil wizard voldemort protecting him. harry still has a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead from that event. since he survived the attack as a baby, and also somehow deprived voldemort from his powers, he has been famous in the wizarding world ever since. the dursleys, strong disbelievers in that magical crap, never told harry anything about his true self. so, harry is strongly surprised, yet absolutely happy to start his training. at hogwarts, harry meets his teachers, and becomes friends with ron weasley and hermione granger. the three of them accidentally find out that the potions master, severus snape, seems to plot on stealing something that is guarded by a three-headed dog. since nobody would believe some first years to have found out such important things that even would incriminate a hogwarts teacher, they take it on themselves to find out what snape is up to. their quest for the truth leads across many obstacles, from keeping up the everyday school life, a bewitched quidditch match (quidditch is a popular wizard sport), fluffy, the three-headed monster dog and quite some tasks one has to overcome to get to the guarded object.        written by  julian reischl
