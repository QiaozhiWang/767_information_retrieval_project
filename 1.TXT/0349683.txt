just not performing the magic seen in excalibur).        written by  payne the roman empire is stretched across many nations, including britain. in their conquest for more land, the romans went into sarmatia where they fought the very brave sarmatian cavalery. the romans, impressed by the sarmatian's weaponery and fighting skills, included them into their army as knights. after 15 years of serving and fighting for the roman empire the sarmatian knights, lead by arthur/artorious castus, are about to receive their freedom as the romans are leaving britain. but the knights must carry out one final order before they are free. a roman priest and his family, especially his son alecto, must be rescued from the invading saxons. but there is another danger lurking on the road to freedom - the woads, british rebels who hate the romans.        written by  andreas furumo this original portrayal of "arthur", as opposed to the mystical elements of the tale in past arthur films, uses names and other elements from the traditional, medieval, catholic arthurian cycle in a very different, yet historically less implausible, almost realistic plot. around 400 ad, the roman empire, stretched across many nations, from arabia to britain, collapsed and skirmishes over power broke out in outlying countries. the conquering romans become impressed with the weaponry and fighting skills of the warrior sarmatian people, which have to send their sons to serve rome fifteen years in the cavalry before these knights may return home. arthur is artorius castus, whose future knights of the round table, eager to achieve their freedom, are charged by bishop germanius with one final task before their discharge: a roman estate tyrant and his family, especially adolescent son alecto, who is selected for a great future in rome, must be rescued thereto from the invading saxons, whose ruthless warrior-king orders his conquering tribal army to pillage and burn entire villages down. but there is another danger lurking on the road to freedom - the woads, celtic britton rebels who hate the romans, lead by the 'magician' merlin, who however realizes rome is no longer the main threat and offers artorius a novel alliance after sparing his life in an ambush.        written by  kgf vissers a demystified take on the tale of king arthur and the knights of the round table.     written by  scott summerton synopsis synopsis of king arthur (2004) some historians believe that the classical 15th century take on king arthur was based on a real hero named artorius castus who lived a thousand years earlier during the roman occupation...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page king arthur storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users the best of keira knightley  created 24 jan 2011      2004  created 03 nov 2011      great action  created 07 nov 2011      the best of best  created 03 sep 2013      ταινιες που πρεπει να δω  created 05 sep 2014      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
