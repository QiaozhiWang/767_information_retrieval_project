"ox" anderson, much greener, is also getting the same new task: protect the navajo codetalkers (ben yahzee and charles whitehorse, respectively). while enders is initially frustrated with his assignment, his respect grows as the codetalkers prove their worth in the brutal battle to take saipan.        written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com in the close quarters and brutal fighting of the world war ii pacific theater, the u.s. intelligence services desperately seek a fool-proof encryption code, immune to the code breakers of the japanese. the answer is soon discovered in the ancient language of the navajo. enlisted into the marine corps are several "windtalkers" who are deployed to frontline areas in the pacific, to use their language as an impossible-to-crack secret code. a drawback, however, is that the u.s. military soon puts forth a directive that the windtalkers must never be captured alive by the enemy, so additional marines are assigned to make certain that this directive is carried out to the letter.        written by  anthony hughes  husnock31@hotmail.com two u.s. marines in wwii are assigned to protect navajo marines who use their native language as an unbreakable radio cypher.     written by  kenneth chisholm synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page windtalkers storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users wwii  created 12 sep 2012      war  created 19 oct 2013      war, history.  created 13 apr 2014      watch later  created 06 feb 2015      2002  created 9 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
