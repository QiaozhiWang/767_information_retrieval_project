"family ties," which was based in columbus, ohio, explored the relationship between steven (a public television station manager), elyse (an architect) and their three children, alex, mallory and jennifer. alex was an avid reagan devotee and card-carrying young republicans club member who sauntered through the house in a shirt and tie and hung a picture of william f. buckley over his bed. but as intelligent and over-achieving as alex was, mallory was as underachieving and, to say the least, a slacker; she was more concerned with shopping and cute guys. jennifer was the precocious youngster who just wanted to be a normal kid. skippy handleman, one of alex's best friends, was a geeky next-door neighbor with an unrequited crush on mallory. during the 1984-1985 season, elyse gave birth to andrew, her and steven's fourth child. alex quickly took his young brother under his wing, and before long andrew was reading the wall street journal over his froot loops cereal. as the years passed, alex graduated from high school (as salutatorian) and pursued a financial degree from leland college. it was there he met his first serious girlfriend, the beautiful ellen reed (played by fox's future wife, tracy pollan). after that relationship ended, alex met psychology major lauren miller. meanwhile, mallory (who was in serious danger of flunking out of high school) found love in the form of rambo-wannabe and high school-dropout nick moore, of whom steven and elyse (at least initially) strongly disapproved; alex disliked the motorcycle-riding nick even more. mallory, however, did graduate from high school and became a fashion design major at grant college. nick also obtained his general-equivalency diploma. while there was time for fun and laughs, many episodes explored serious topics, such as: teen pregnancy, censorship, addiction to pills, the effects racial minority homeowners have on property values and grieving the loss of a close friend. other episodes dealt with steven's distant relationships with his own family, particularly his brother, robert, while plenty of episodes presented flashbacks of earlier episodes featuring the keaton offspring as young children. by the time the series wrapped up, alex accepted his dream job offer...a job on new york's wall street.        written by  brian rathjen  briguy_52732@yahoo.com chronicles liberal ex-hippies steven and elyse keaton, their conservative son alex, daughters mallory and jennifer, and later, youngest child andrew.     written by  anonymous synopsis be the first to contribute! just click the "edit page" button at the bottom of the page   or learn more in the  synopsis submission guide see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page family ties storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv episode list episode cast rated episodes date vote tv schedule related items newsdesk external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users 20 favorite tv shows  created 26 dec 2010      the 25 greatest sitcoms of the 80's  created 19 may 2011      my favorite 25 tv shows  created 28 aug 2011      top 50 tv shows  created 24 feb 2012      favorite television shows  created 04 sep 2013      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
