a congressional committee visits occupied berlin to investigate g.i. morals. congresswoman phoebe frost, appalled at widespread evidence of human frailty, hears rumors that cafe singer erika, former mistress of a wanted war criminal, is "protected" by an american officer, and enlists captain john pringle to help her find him...not knowing that pringle is erika's lover.        written by  rod crawford  puffinus@u.washington.edu a us congressional committee is in berlin following world war ii to investigate rumors of low morale amongst the american troops patrolling the american quadrant of the city. one of those on the committee is congresswoman phoebe frost, a republican from iowa who has a singular focus on work, especially when on a mission. once in berlin, she believes the committee's military liaison, colonel rufus j. plummer, is providing them with a false report of the issue as she herself has witnessed firsthand what she considers the depravity occurring in the city, especially between american troops and german "fraulein". specifically, she is concerned about an unofficial report of erika von schl√ºtow, a singer at an underground cabaret, who was a high ranking nazi during the war and whose record is being protected and expunged by a high ranking but unknown american military man. to find out who this military man is, phoebe enlists the help of captain john pringle, a fellow iowan who she met on her travels in berlin and who she trusts because of his iowa heritage. she is however unaware that john is erika's lover and protector. john does whatever he needs to to keep this secret from phoebe for the few days she's in town. his measures include pretending to have a romantic interest in her himself. phoebe comes to her own incorrect conclusion of who is protecting erika. erika, on the other hand, has her own agenda which she demonstrates in an encounter with phoebe. meanwhile, john's secret from phoebe may become compromised when colonel plummer, aware of john and erika's relationship, asks john to perform a military task concerning hunting down hans otto birgel, a missing member of the gestapo who was a former companion of erika's.        written by  huggo in a wrecked post-war berlin, a congressional committee from the united states of america comes to the occupied city to investigate the moral of the american troops. the conservative republican congresswoman phoebe frost from iowa brings a birthday cake to captain john pringle from his girlfriend also from iowa. later she splits from the other congressmen and decides to investigate the decadence of the military on her own, and not in accordance with the official speech and visit promoted by colonel rufus j. plummer. she meets two american privates that believe she is german. they take her to the night-club lorelei, where the lead attraction is the singer erika von schluetow, who is the secret mistress of captain pringle. congresswoman frost overhears that erika belonged to the nazi party and is protected by a senior officer, and she enlists her fellow countryman captain pringle to help her in the investigation of erika. the officer seduces frost to protect erika and himself from martial court, but the jealous former lover of erika, the nazi hans otto birgel, is seeking revenge against his competitor.        written by  claudio carvalho, rio de janeiro, brazil in occupied berlin, an army captain is torn between an ex-nazi cafe singer and the u.s. congresswoman investigating her.     written by  rod crawford
