a client of rutland - who was hired there solely for her good looks, and who reportedly stole $10,000 from its office safe. marnie does not recognize mark. mark wants to find out her story. he begins to do so after she manages to steal money out of the rutland office safe. mark did some research on her and she, who is between a rock and a hard place concerning this most recent theft, eventually fills in the rest of the details concerning her criminal activities. however, mark doesn't send her to prison, but rather has a proposition for her which she can't refuse. this agreement with mark ends up being her own kind of prison, from which she tries to escape. while mark tries to understand why marnie is the way that she is, which includes seemingly morbid fears of thunderstorms, saturated instances of the color red, and being touched by men, mark's sister-in-law, lil mainwaring, who seems to have aspirations to be the next mrs. mark rutland, tries to find out what marnie and mark are hiding. if lil is successful, marnie's past could catch up with her and mark and their arrangement.        written by  huggo marnie edgar is an ice-cold habitual thief. she uses her looks to gain the confidence of her employers, robs them, and changes her identity. her only loves are her horse and her mother, although she has problems with the latter relationship. marnie applies for a job at mark rutland's philadelphia publishing company. mark recognises her since he is a client of her last employer, but instead of turning her in, he decides to watch her.        written by  col needham  col@imdb.com the beautiful marnie edgar is a first-class bookkeeper and the apple of her employers' eyes. she happens also to be a compulsive thief who has taken her last employer, sidney strutt, to the cleaners before disappearing into thin air. but with mark rutland she attempts robbery once too often. he forces her to marry him, and out of love for her uncovers the mysteries of her past that contribute to her penchant for taking other people's money.        written by  filmfactsman mark marries marnie although she is a habitual thief and has serious psychological problems, and tries to help her confront and resolve them.     written by  anonymous synopsis the story opens as a woman with dark hair, seen only from behind, carries a suitcase along a train platform...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page marnie storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users policier  created 03 oct 2011      watched and loved  created 21 aug 2013      films,that i had seen in october 2013  created 03 oct 2013      hitchcock's  created 03 jul 2014      1960's  created 1 month ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
