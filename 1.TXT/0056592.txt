"you never know someone," atticus tells scout, "until you step inside their skin and walk around a little." but fear keeps them at a distance until one night, in streetlight and shadows, the children confront an evil born of ignorance and blind hatred, and must somehow find their way home.        written by  mark fleetwood  mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu the place: a small town in the southern united states. the time: the early 1930s. the story: a black man is accused of raping a caucasian woman, and an idealistic lawyer offers to defend him. as one begins observing the reasons that make his defense far from easy, it becomes evident the reason lies in that no one in this town seems willing to believe in the innocence of an accused negro.        written by  brian daly  bd64kcmo@aol.com atticus finch, a lawyer in the depression-era south, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.     written by  jon reeves  jreeves@imdb.com synopsis the titles appear as a young child babbles while picking through childhood mementos found in a cigar box. an adult woman is recalling formative events of her childhood in the small alabama town of macomb...   see full synopsis see also taglines synopsis plot keywords parents guide getting started contributor zone contribute to this page edit page to kill a mockingbird storyline taglines plot summary synopsis plot keywords parents guide details full cast and crew release dates official sites box office/business company credits filming locations technical specs literature did you know? trivia goofs crazy credits quotes alternate versions connections soundtracks photo  video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards faq user reviews user ratings external reviews metacritic reviews message board tv tv schedule related items newsdesk showtimes external sites explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users favourites  created 10 nov 2011      top 30 movies!  created 26 may 2012      ashleys list  created 20 aug 2013      must watch - classics  created 29 oct 2014      jan 2016: black history month  created 3 months ago      see all related lists imdb everywhere find showtimes, watch trailers, browse photos, track your watchlist and rate your favorite movies and tv shows on your phone or tablet! imdb mobile site home top rated movies box office tv coming soon site index search in theaters contact us message boards register news press room advertising jobs imdbpro box office mojo withoutabox conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads copyright  1990-2016          imdb.com, inc. amazon.com company.        amazon video watch movies  tv online prime video unlimited streaming of movies  tv amazon germany buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon italy buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon france buy movies on dvd  blu-ray amazon india buy movie and tv show dvds dpreview digital photography audible download audio books
