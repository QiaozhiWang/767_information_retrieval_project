the north dakota badlands to hunt bison in september 1883. during that first short trip, he got his bison and fell in love with the rugged lifestyle and the "perfect freedom" of the west. he invested $14,000 in the maltese cross ranch, which was already being managed by sylvane ferris and bill merrifield seven miles south of medora. that winter, ferris and merrifield built the maltese cross cabin. after the death of both his wife and his mother on february 14, 1884, teddy roosevelt returned to his north dakota ranch seeking solitude and time to heal. that summer, he started his second ranch, the elkhorn ranch, 35 miles north of medora, which he hired two maine woodsmen, bill sewall and wilmot dow, to operate. teddy roosevelt took great interest in his ranches and in hunting in the west, detailing his experiences in pieces published in eastern newspapers and magazines. he wrote three major works on his life in the west: "ranch life and the hunting trail," "hunting trips of a ranchman," and "the wilderness hunter." his adventures in "the strenuous life" outdoors and the loss of his cattle in the starvation winter in 1886-1887 were influential in theodore roosevelt's pursuit of conservation policies as president of the united states (19011909). park development edit following theodore roosevelt's death in 1919, the little missouri badlands were explored to determine possible park sites.  civilian conservation corps roosevelt recreation demonstration area united states fish and wildlife service theodore roosevelt national wildlife refuge theodore roosevelt national memorial park km 2 theodore roosevelt wilderness theodore roosevelt national park attractions edit 3 both main units of the park have scenic drives, approximately 100 miles of foot and horse trails, wildlife viewing, and opportunities for back country hiking and camping. there are three developed campgrounds: juniper campground in the north unit, cottonwood campground in the south unit, and the roundup group horse campground in the south unit. one of the most popular attractions is wildlife viewing. the park is home to a wide variety of great plains wildlife including  bison mountain lion feral horses elk bighorn sheep white-tailed deer mule deer prairie dogs golden eagles sharp-tailed grouse wild turkeys the scenery changes constantly in relationship with the seasons. the brown, dormant grass dominates from late summer through the winter, but explodes into green color in the early summer along with hundreds of species of flowering plants. winter can be a beautiful scene as snow covers the sharp terrain of the badlands and locks the park into what theodore roosevelt called "an abode of iron desolation." theodore roosevelt's maltese cross cabin the badlands are very important in theodore roosevelt's life, and the park memorializes his contributions to the conservation of america's natural resources. a museum at the south unit visitor center provides background on theodore roosevelt and his ranching days. roosevelt's maltese cross cabin is open for public viewing year-round at the south unit visitor center. roosevelt's  elkhorn ranch the park is popular for back country hiking and horseback riding. permits for back country camping may be obtained at the south unit or north unit visitor centers. over 100 miles of trail make it a fine hiking park, though water and shade are limited along trails. the park units are mostly surrounded by  forest service grasslands northern lights the entire park has been surrounded with a 7-foot (2.1 m) tall woven wire fence to keep bison and feral horses inside the park and commercial livestock out. other animals are able to pass over, under, or through the fence in specific locations provided for that purpose. the town of medora, at the entrance to the south unit, provides a touristy western experience, with wooden planked sidewalks, old fashioned ice cream parlors, and buggy rides. there are several museums and the burning hills amphitheather with nightly productions of the " medora musical park officials manage populations of bison, horses, and elk to maintain a balanced ecosystem. biologists also monitor prairie dog towns, though the park only controls their population in instances where they pose a threat to buildings or human health. gallery edit nokota horses badlands during
