external links natural history edit sangre de cristo range the park contains the tallest  sand dunes north america m) from the floor of the  san luis valley sangre de cristo range ha). researchers say that the dunes started forming less than 440,000 years ago. the dunes were formed from sand and soil deposits of the  rio grande tributaries flood plain 4 there are several streams flowing on the perimeter of the dunes. the streams erode the edge of the dune field, and sand is carried downstream. the water disappears into the ground, depositing sand on the surface. winds pick up the deposits of sand, and blow them up onto the dune field once again. digging a couple inches into the dunes even at their peaks reveals wet sand. part of the motivation of turning the monument into a national park was the extra protection of the water, which colorado's cities and agriculture covet. it is very easy to experience the dune-building process. this is a very windy region, as hikers on the sand dunes will attest, as on many days they will be pelted by sand and even small rocks when hiking on the dunes. the wind carries sand and rocks from many miles away. while the dunes don't change location or size that often, there are still parabolic dunes that start in the sand sheet, the outer area around the dunes, and migrate towards the main dune field. sometimes they join the main dune field, and sometimes they will get covered with grass and vegetation and remain where they are. the dunes are relatively stable, however their morphology changes slightly with the seasons. the direction of the wind greatly affects the dune type. the winds normally go from southwest to northeast, however during the late summer months, the wind direction reverses causing reversing dunes. this wind regime is part of the reason why the dunes are so tall. the dunes contain areas of black sand which are deposits of  magnetite crystalline oxide iron climate edit the great sand dunes sit on a large area of "high desert" land in the  san luis valley sangre de cristo mountains f (35 c) are not uncommon in july and august. the large variation between high and low temperatures are typical of the high desert climate. low temperatures during winter nights can be exceedingly cold, with several night temperatures dropping below 0 f (18 c) in the winter. further off of the great sand dunes in this high desert valley, precipitation numbers are exceedingly low. however, precipitation is still very low on the great sand dunes, averaging just above 11 inches (280 mm) of rainfall per year. the high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as desert land still, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250 mm). it does snow on the dunes as well, but snowfall is usually very short-lived in the dry and sunny climate that is common in this area of colorado. climate data for great sand dunes national park and preserve month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec

edit the park also contains alpine lakes and  tundra over 13,000 feet spruce pine aspen cottonwood grasslands wetlands one of the most unusual features of the park happens at medano creek, which borders the east side of the dunes and is located next to the visitor center and bookstore. because fresh sand continually falls in the creek, medano creek never finds a permanent and stable streambed. small underwater sand dunes that act like dams continually form and break down, and so waders in the stream see surgeswhich look like wavesof water flowing downstream at intervals of anywhere from just a few seconds to a minute or more. in a high-water year, these surges can be as much as a foot in height, resembling  ocean waves zapata falls one of the most valued features of the great sand dunes national park and preserve is one that cannot be seen. according to a recent soundscape study conducted by the national park service, this park is the quietest national park in the 48 contiguous united states. many visitors to the site try to sled down the dunes. the park service provides hints as to the best time to sled (when the sand is wet) and which equipment works best. visitors anytime other than late fall through early spring are also advised to avoid bare feet or sandals, and stick with sturdy, closed footwear. while the sand looks alluring, its chocolate color absorbs heat. the daylight sand temperature can reach 140 f (60 c) and will burn bare feet. plants and animals edit there are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. trees include  douglass fir pinyon pine aspen rocky mountain juniper three-leaf sumac bristlecone pine red osier dogwood 6 among the flowering plants are  alpine phlox dwarf clover alpine forget-me-not fairy primrose alpine aven indian paintbrush lousewort blue-purple penstemon aspen daisy western paintbrush elephantella snow
