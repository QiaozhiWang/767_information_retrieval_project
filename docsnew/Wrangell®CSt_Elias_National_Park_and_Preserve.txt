lands, which only allow subsistence hunting by local rural residents, and preserve lands, which allow sport hunting by the general public. preserve lands include the chitina valley north of the river, two parts of the copper river valley east of the river, most of the chisana and nabesna valleys, and lands along yakutat bay. 5 the park is accessible by highway from  anchorage mccarthy road nabesna road 10 10 11 nabesna chisana kennicott mccarthy km) mccarthy road.  chitina edgerton highway 5 activities edit the edgerton highway runs along the valley of the copper river on the western margin of

bringing flowers and biting insects, with maximum temperatures of 80 f (27 c). late summers can bring drizzle. it begins to get cool in august, and first snows fall in september. conditions are more temperate along the coast, and the high mountains retain snow all year. 14 the kendesnii campground on the nabesna road is the only park service-managed campground in the park. there are a number of private campgrounds and lodgings on the mccarthy and nabesna roads, and there are fourteen public-use cabins. most of these cabins are accessible only by air. 15 16 17 18 copper nizina chitina 19 20

lands. subsistence hunting by local residents is permitted in both the park and preserve. hunting is managed jointly by the national park service, and the alaska department of fish and game, which issues hunting licenses. the use of off-road vehicles (orvs) is restricted to specific routes and permits are required to use orvs in the preserve. 28 geology edit the southern part of alaska is composed of a series of  terranes plate tectonics pacific plate north american plate cm) to 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) per year, 29 subducts island arcs 30 31 32 1964 alaska earthquake 33 34 six terranes and one sedimentary belt have been documented in wrangellst. elias. from north to south, and oldest to youngest, they are the windy or yukon-tanana (180 million years ago), gravina-nutzotin belt (120 mya), wrangellia, alexander, chugach (previously assembled elsewhere, then accreted as the wrangellia composite terrane 110-67 mya), prince william (50mya) and yakutat terranes (beginning 26 mya). 35 36 the alaskan coast reached an approximation of its modern configuration about 50 million years ago, with the complete subduction of the now-vanished  kula plate 33 million years. the oldest volcanoes in wrangellst. elias national park and preserve are about 26 million years old, near the alaska-yukon territory border in the st. elias range. activity has moved north and west from that area. 7 volcanic activity edit the majority of the volcanoes in the wrangell volcanic field lie at the western end of the wrangell mountains. the western wrangell volcanoes are unusual for subduction-related volcanoes, in their generally non-explosive nature. the majority of the volcanoes are unusually large  shield volcanoes andesite 37 shield volcanoes calderas cinder cones 38 the ten highest summits in the wrangell mountains are all of volcanic origin, and several are among the most voluminous volcanoes in the world.  mount wrangell 38 m) in height. it was built by a series of large lava flows from 600,000 to 200,000 years ago. three comparatively modest eruptive episodes were reported in 1784, 188485 and 1900. the gently sloping dome features an ice-filled summit caldera measuring 3.6 miles (5.8 km) by 2.5 miles (4.0 km). three craters containing fumaroles produce a steam plume that can be visible on calm, clear days. the summit produces occasional  phreatic eruptions million cubic metres (3.5 10 9 cu ft) of ice and form a small crater lake. that activity has subsided since 1986 and ice has accumulated since. the last large eruption of magma from wrangell is estimated to have been about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. the summit caldera is estimated to have collapsed between 200,000 and 50,000 years ago. 13,009-foot (3,965 m) mount zanetti is a large cinder cone on wrangell's northwest flank, estimated to be less than 25,000 years old. 39 40 mount drum m) high, it dominates the local landscape more than much higher mountains. mount drum is either a shield volcano or a  stratovolcano m). these eruptions generated extensive mudflows, and represent the last activity at mount drum. mount drum supports at least eleven glaciers that flow from its summit icefield. 41 mount sanford m), the 13th highest peak in north america. it is a complex shield volcano that first formed about 900,000 years ago. the latest eruption is estimated to have been between 320,000 and 100,000 years ago. like drum, sanford has a large icefield above 8,000 feet (2,400 m) that feeds a series of glaciers. 42 capital mountain m) in height. it is a shield volcano, about 10 miles (16 km) in diameter. its summit has collapsed to form a caldera roughly 2.5 miles (4.0 km) in diameter. its last activity was about a million years ago, and it has been deeply eroded by glacial activity. 43 tanada peak m) tall with a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 5-mile (8.0 km) summit caldera. the shield volcano last erupted 900,000 years ago and has been dissected by glaciers. 44 skookum creek volcano million and 2 million years ago. 7,125 feet (2,172 m) high at its highest point, the old shield volcano has been severely eroded. its caldera is surrounded by a series of  dacite rhyolite mount jarvis m) high, with one or more indistinct summit calderas. it is covered with ice and erupted between 1.7 million and 1 million years ago. 45 mount blackburn m) the highest point in the wrangells, the 12th highest peak in north america,and the oldest volcano in the range. it is a shield volcano with a filled caldera that was active between 4.2 million and 3.4 million years ago. mount blackburn is ice-covered and is the source of kennicott glacier and nabesna glacier, among others. 45 boomerang volcano m). it is at least one million years old and is overlaid by deposits from capital mountain. 46 mount gordon m). 47 several hot springs or  mud volcanoes carbon dioxide m) high and 8,000 feet (2,400 m) in diameter. 40 48 the chief volcanoes in the st. elias range are  mount bona mount churchill m) and 15,638 feet (4,766 m), respectively, they are the highest and fourth-highest volcanoes in the united states and the fourth and seventh highest in north america, 49 49 white river ash 40 49 glaciers and icefields edit the mountain ranges of wrangellst. elias account for 60 percent of glacial ice in alaska, covering more than 1,700 square miles (4,400 km 2 lake atna wisconsin glaciation 50 km) the longest tidewater glacier in alaska, and the nabesna glacier is the world's longest valley glacier, at more than 75 miles (121 km). 51 glaciers in wrangellst. elias are mostly in retreat. the bagley icefield has grown thinner and its glaciers have retreated, including portions feeding malaspina glacier, which is stagnant or retreating. malaspina's west and east lobes filled icy bay and yakutat bay, respectively, about 1000 years ago, and guyot, yahtse and tynall glaciers have individually retreated at the head of icy bay. 52 53 54 minerals edit five major mining districts were developed in wrangellst. elias during the heyday of mining between the 1890s and 1960. gold was found in the bremner district in 1901, and in the nizina area near kennecott. most of the gold from these areas was  placer hydraulic mining 55 the chief source of copper was the kennecott lode next to the kennicott glacier. the  copper sulfide chalcocite malachite azurite dolomite 56

alaskans, who regarded the designation under the antiquities act as a federal land grab. the few park service personnel assigned to the area received threats, and a park service airplane was destroyed by fire in august 1979. attitudes were sharply divided between white alaskans, who were largely opposed to the park and felt that they were being forced out, and native ahtnas, who were granted subsistence hunting rights and who expected to profit from tourism. 81 national park and preserve edit in january 1979, udall introduced a modified version of h.r. 39. following markup and negotiations between the house and senate versions, the bill as modified by the senate was approved by the house on november 12. 82 2, 1980, the anilca bill was signed into law by jimmy carter, converting wrangellst. elias to a national park and preserve with an initial area of 8,147,000 acres (3,297,000 ha) in the park and 4,171,000 acres (1,688,000 ha) in the preserve. 83 ha) of wilderness, stipulated in a somewhat less restrictive manner than standard practice in the continental united states. 84 opposition to the park persisted after congressional designation from some alaskans, who resented federal government presence in general and national park service presence in particular. vandalism persisted, with a ranger cabin burned and an airplane damaged, while others skirted regulations and voiced resentment of what, in their view, was an elitist attitude embodied in the park and the park service. 85 86 john birch society united nations 87 the state of alaska proposed major improvements to the mccarthy road in 1997, planning to pave it and add scenic turnouts and trailheads along its length. although the road remains gravel, it has been widened and smoothed. some rental car agencies continue to prohibit use of their vehicles on the mccarthy road. 88 additional designations edit the transborder park system  kluane / wrangellst. elias / glacier
