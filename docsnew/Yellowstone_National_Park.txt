however, the designation "pleasure ground" was not an invitation to create an amusement park. hayden imagined something akin to the scenic resorts and baths in england, germany, and switzerland. 26 the act of dedication 28 an act to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the yellowstone river as a public park. be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, that the tract of land in the territories of montana and wyoming approved march 1, 1872. signed by: james g. blaine schuyler colfax ulysses s. grant nathaniel p. langford 29 there was considerable local opposition to the yellowstone national park during its early years. some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. 30 31 after the park's official formation, nathaniel langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. he served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. this left yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. he addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 report to the secretary of the interior 32 william ludlow george armstrong custer report of a reconnaissance to the yellowstone national park george bird grinnell grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides.

this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. 98 national elk refuge pronghorn in 2003 the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. no visual confirmation was made, however. lynx have not been seen in yellowstone since 1998, though  dna 99 wolverine 100 101 eighteen species of fish live in yellowstone, including the core range of the  yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers 8 102 lake trout invasive species 103 shoshone lewis 104 whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. 102 reptiles painted turtle prairie rattlesnake amphibians boreal chorus frog 105 311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in yellowstone. 8 whooping cranes 106 common loon harlequin duck osprey peregrine falcon trumpeter swan 107 forest fires edit see also:  yellowstone fires of 1988 1988 north american drought as  wildfire indigenous douglas-fir lodgepole pines subalpine fir engelmann spruce whitebark pine aspen 108 108 about thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning fire lookout towers 109 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. 110 111 wildfire pyrocumulus cloud in an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  controlled burns 112 1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. the national park service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. between july 15 and 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. by the end of the month, the fires were out of control. large fires burned together, and on august 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. a total of 25,000 firefighters and u.s. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. by the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. 54 contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the united states, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. by 1992, yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. 54 climate edit yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. the record high temperature was 99 f (37 c) in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is 66 f (54 c) in 1933. 8 f (21 to 27 c) range, while night time lows can go to below freezing (0 c) especially at higher altitudes. summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms f (1 and 16 c) with nights in the teens to single digits (5 to 20 c). winter in yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between zero to 20 f (20 to 5 c) and nighttime temperatures below 0  f (18 c) for most of the winter. 113 precipitation in yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near mammoth hot springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. the precipitation of yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  snake river plain mm) annually around yellowstone lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. 113 tornadoes teton wilderness bridger-teton national forest tetonyellowstone tornado f4 km/h). the tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (39 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha;
