indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the big bend. the chisos indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. the origin of the chisos indians is not known. linguistically, they were associated with the conchos indians of northern chihuahua and northwestern coahuila. their language group spoke a

(including 60 cactus species), over 600 species of vertebrates, and about 3600 insect species. the variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry, hot desert, the cool mountains, and the fertile river valley. most of the animals are not visible in the day, particularly in the desert. the park comes alive at night, with many of the animals foraging
