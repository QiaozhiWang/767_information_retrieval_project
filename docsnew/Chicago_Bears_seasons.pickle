indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the big bend. the chisos indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. the origin of the chisos indians is not known. linguistically, they were associated with the conchos indians of northern chihuahua and northwestern coahuila. their language group spoke a

projects. the undeveloped keys south of key biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. one proposal included building a highway linking the biscayne bay keys to the  overseas highway 37 islandia 38 39 in 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of biscayne bay, to be known as seadade. seadade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate  daniel k. ludwig m) channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. the channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. 39 florida power and light l) announced plans for two new 400- megawatt 40 many local residents and politicians supported seadade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. they fought against development of the bay and formed the safe progress association. led by lloyd miller, the president of the local chapter of the  izaak walton league miami herald 39 miami herald 41 dante fascell claude r. kirk, jr. herbert hoover, jr. 42 one vision of islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern florida keys km). islandia landowners called it elliott key boulevard, but called it "spite highway" privately. it was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on elliott key now follows the path of elliott key boulevard. 39 the oil-fired turkey point power stations were completed in 196768 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into biscayne bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. 43 l announced plans for two 693 mw nuclear reactors at the site, 44 45 portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park\'s establishment. homestead bayfront park, still operated by miami-dade county just south of convoy point, established a "blacks-only" segregated beach for african-americans at the present site of the dante fascell visitor center. the segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished. 46 park establishment and history edit the earliest proposals

dade county park system. 48 49 president lyndon b. johnson signed public law 90-606 to create biscayne national monument on october 18, 1968. the monument was expanded in 1974 under public law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of congress 39 50 51 52 the first islandia property owner to sell land to the  national park service ha) at the age of

park service to the dade county  state attorney\'s office janet reno 38 47 the impact of hurricane andrew on neighboring  homestead air force base miami international airport mi (3.2 km) to the east,

the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the dante fascell visitor center at convoy point. all other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. activities include boating, fishing,  kayaking windsurfing snorkeling scuba diving 62 although it is a federally designated park, fishing within biscayne is governed by the state of florida. anglers in biscayne are required to have a florida recreational saltwater fishing license. fishing is limited to designated sport fish,  spiny lobster stone crab blue crab 63 64 a private concessioner provides tours from the park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. most tours are operated during the peak winter season from january to april. 65 personal watercraft 66 67 island facilities edit most of biscayne\'s permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. a seasonally staffed ranger station is located on elliott key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. a single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the spite highway runs the length of the island. 68 69 70 snorkeling and diving edit snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. the reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. a selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the maritime heritage trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the national park service system. 71 arratoon apcar erl king alicia lugano mandalay alicia erl king lugano 72 mandalay 73 historical structures edit main article:  national

climate reflects its location in extreme south florida. southern miami-dade county is classified as  tropical savanna kppen-geiger 132 f (19 and 24 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 2.1 inches (53 mm). wet season temperatures average between 76 and 85 f (24 and 29 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 5.39 inches (137 mm). the wet season roughly coincides with  hurricane season 133 like many locations in southern florida, biscayne national park is affected by hurricanes every few years. most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. a direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events. 134 135 1906 florida keys hurricane 28 1926 miami hurricane 1929 bahamas hurricane 1935 labor day hurricane 136 1935 yankee hurricane 1941 florida hurricane 1945 southeast florida

142 the fowey rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of 127 knots (235 km/h) and a gust to 147 knots (272 km/h) before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. the strongest part of the eyewall had not reached fowey rocks when it stopped transmitting. 143 since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. park service studies project that much of the park\'s land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. 144 cm) by 2030, and 9 to 24

"eight of the twelve-man crew left after a few days, terrified of the task in front of them. what the rest of the men saw was spectacular and had never been seen by another human." bryant reported that the black canyon was impenetrable, and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths. 13 heeding bryant\'s advice, palmer decided to route the railroad south of the canyon and in march 1883, it completed its connection to  salt lake city 14 rudyard kipling 15 by 1890, an alternate route through  glenwood springs 16 in 1901, the u.s. geological survey sent abraham lincoln fellows and william torrence into the canyon to look for a site to build a diversion tunnel bringing water to the uncompahgre valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. 17 18 construction on the tunnel began 4 years later, and was fraught with difficulties right from the onset. "working conditions at the tunnel were difficult due to the high levels of carbon dioxide, excessive temperatures, humidity, water, mud, shale, sand, and a fractured fault zone...it took the tunneling crew almost one year to bore through 2000 feet of water-filled rock. the tunnel was driven through granite, quartzite, gneiss, and shale as well as layers of sandstone, coal, and limestone. work on the gunnison tunnel was first done manually and by candlelight. one miner would hold the drill and rotate it while the second miner would use a sledgehammer to drive the drill into the rock. this work required strong, hard-working men. in spite of good pay and fringe benefits, most disliked the dangerous underground conditions and stayed an average of only 2 weeks." 26 men were killed during the 4 year undertaking. the tunnel was finally completed in 1909, stretching a distance of 5.8 miles and costing nearly 3 million dollars. at the time, the gunnison tunnel held the honor of being the world\'s longest irrigation tunnel. on september 23, president william howard taft dedicated the tunnel in montrose. 19 20 the black canyon of the gunnison was established as a  u.s. national monument national park 21 civilian conservation corps north rim road national park service national register of historic places 22 biology edit the black canyon of the gunnison national park contains a wide variety of flora and fauna. some common plants native to the park include  aspen ponderosa pine sagebrush mahogany cercocarpus utah juniper gambel oak scrub oak single-leaf ash 23 black canyon gilia aliciella penstemonoides 24 coyote elk magpie eagle mule deer great horned owl american dipper steller\'s jay mountain bluebird peregrine falcon white-throated swift canyon wren 25 attractions edit an estimated 250,000 tourists visit the park annually. the main attraction of the park is the scenic drive along us highway 50 and colorado highway 92, as well as the south rim. the west end of the park, where it meet blue mesa reservoir at blue mesa point, is the area most developed for camping. it includes tent camping and rv parking with full hookups as well as canyon tours, hiking, fishing and boat tours. the west end of the park has river access by automobile, as well as guided tours of the canyon. a short hike at blue mesa point information center heads down to pine creek and the morrow point boat tours, boating, fishing and hiking. at the south rim there are two  campgrounds hiking m) in length. the river can also be accessed by steep, unmaintained trails called routes or draws on the north and south rim. these routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up, depending on which route is taken. all inner canyon descents are strenuous and require class 3 climbing and basic route finding skills. steep talus, impassable ledges, and lack of cover are some of the challenges hikers are faced with. poison ivy also grows abundantly in the draws and on the canyon floor. long sleeves and hiking boots are strongly recommended. the flow rate of the gunnison river should also be considered for those planning on camping in the canyon, as high river levels can wash out the camp sites. the national park service warns the following: "routes are difficult to follow, and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes 26 the gunnison river is designated as a gold medal water from 200 yards downstream of crystal reservoir dam to the north fork. this includes the 12 miles within the black canyon of the gunnison national park. only artificial flies and lures are permitted, and all rainbow trout are catch and release. additionally, fishing is prohibited within 200 yards downstream of crystal dam. 27 the black canyon is a center for  rock climbing traditional climbing 28 rafting opportunities exist in the region, but the run through the park itself is a difficult technical run for only the best kayakers. there are several impassable stretches of water requiring long, sometimes dangerous portages. the remaining rapids are class iii - v, and are only for expert river runners. 29 30 31 references edit 2012-03-06 2015-06-16 a b vandenbusche, duane (2009).  images of america - the black canyon of the gunnison 7.  isbn 978-0-7385-6919-2 help a b 2007-07-29 2006-10-27 2006-10-27 tweto, o (1980).  colorado geology 3746. a b c trista thornberry-ehrlich (2005).  pdf 2006-10-27 2007-07-29 2014-07-28 2014-06-24 1. help vandenbusche, duane (2009).  images of america - the black canyon of the gunnison 8.  isbn 978-0-7385-6919-2 help 2007-07-29 kipling, rudyard (1900).  from sea to sea, and other sketches isbn 978-1596058248 2014-07-29 athearn, robert (1977).  the denver and rio grande western railroad isbn 0-8032-0920-7 frank, jerritt (2003-01-01).
