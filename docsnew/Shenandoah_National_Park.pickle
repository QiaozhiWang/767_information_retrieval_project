indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the big bend. the chisos indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. the origin of the chisos indians is not known. linguistically, they were associated with the conchos indians of northern chihuahua and northwestern coahuila. their language group spoke a

projects. the undeveloped keys south of key biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. one proposal included building a highway linking the biscayne bay keys to the  overseas highway 37 islandia 38 39 in 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of biscayne bay, to be known as seadade. seadade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate  daniel k. ludwig m) channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. the channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. 39 florida power and light l) announced plans for two new 400- megawatt 40 many local residents and politicians supported seadade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. they fought against development of the bay and formed the safe progress association. led by lloyd miller, the president of the local chapter of the  izaak walton league miami herald 39 miami herald 41 dante fascell claude r. kirk, jr. herbert hoover, jr. 42 one vision of islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern florida keys km). islandia landowners called it elliott key boulevard, but called it "spite highway" privately. it was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on elliott key now follows the path of elliott key boulevard. 39 the oil-fired turkey point power stations were completed in 196768 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into biscayne bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. 43 l announced plans for two 693 mw nuclear reactors at the site, 44 45 portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park\'s establishment. homestead bayfront park, still operated by miami-dade county just south of convoy point, established a "blacks-only" segregated beach for african-americans at the present site of the dante fascell visitor center. the segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished. 46 park establishment and history edit the earliest proposals

dade county park system. 48 49 president lyndon b. johnson signed public law 90-606 to create biscayne national monument on october 18, 1968. the monument was expanded in 1974 under public law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of congress 39 50 51 52 the first islandia property owner to sell land to the  national park service ha) at the age of

park service to the dade county  state attorney\'s office janet reno 38 47 the impact of hurricane andrew on neighboring  homestead air force base miami international airport mi (3.2 km) to the east,

the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the dante fascell visitor center at convoy point. all other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. activities include boating, fishing,  kayaking windsurfing snorkeling scuba diving 62 although it is a federally designated park, fishing within biscayne is governed by the state of florida. anglers in biscayne are required to have a florida recreational saltwater fishing license. fishing is limited to designated sport fish,  spiny lobster stone crab blue crab 63 64 a private concessioner provides tours from the park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. most tours are operated during the peak winter season from january to april. 65 personal watercraft 66 67 island facilities edit most of biscayne\'s permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. a seasonally staffed ranger station is located on elliott key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. a single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the spite highway runs the length of the island. 68 69 70 snorkeling and diving edit snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. the reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. a selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the maritime heritage trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the national park service system. 71 arratoon apcar erl king alicia lugano mandalay alicia erl king lugano 72 mandalay 73 historical structures edit main article:  national

climate reflects its location in extreme south florida. southern miami-dade county is classified as  tropical savanna kppen-geiger 132 f (19 and 24 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 2.1 inches (53 mm). wet season temperatures average between 76 and 85 f (24 and 29 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 5.39 inches (137 mm). the wet season roughly coincides with  hurricane season 133 like many locations in southern florida, biscayne national park is affected by hurricanes every few years. most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. a direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events. 134 135 1906 florida keys hurricane 28 1926 miami hurricane 1929 bahamas hurricane 1935 labor day hurricane 136 1935 yankee hurricane 1941 florida hurricane 1945 southeast florida

142 the fowey rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of 127 knots (235 km/h) and a gust to 147 knots (272 km/h) before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. the strongest part of the eyewall had not reached fowey rocks when it stopped transmitting. 143 since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. park service studies project that much of the park\'s land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. 144 cm) by 2030, and 9 to 24

"eight of the twelve-man crew left after a few days, terrified of the task in front of them. what the rest of the men saw was spectacular and had never been seen by another human." bryant reported that the black canyon was impenetrable, and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths. 13 heeding bryant\'s advice, palmer decided to route the railroad south of the canyon and in march 1883, it completed its connection to  salt lake city 14 rudyard kipling 15 by 1890, an alternate route through  glenwood springs 16 in 1901, the u.s. geological survey sent abraham lincoln fellows and william torrence into the canyon to look for a site to build a diversion tunnel bringing water to the uncompahgre valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. 17 18 construction on the tunnel began 4 years later, and was fraught with difficulties right from the onset. "working conditions at the tunnel were difficult due to the high levels of carbon dioxide, excessive temperatures, humidity, water, mud, shale, sand, and a fractured fault zone...it took the tunneling crew almost one year to bore through 2000 feet of water-filled rock. the tunnel was driven through granite, quartzite, gneiss, and shale as well as layers of sandstone, coal, and limestone. work on the gunnison tunnel was first done manually and by candlelight. one miner would hold the drill and rotate it while the second miner would use a sledgehammer to drive the drill into the rock. this work required strong, hard-working men. in spite of good pay and fringe benefits, most disliked the dangerous underground conditions and stayed an average of only 2 weeks." 26 men were killed during the 4 year undertaking. the tunnel was finally completed in 1909, stretching a distance of 5.8 miles and costing nearly 3 million dollars. at the time, the gunnison tunnel held the honor of being the world\'s longest irrigation tunnel. on september 23, president william howard taft dedicated the tunnel in montrose. 19 20 the black canyon of the gunnison was established as a  u.s. national monument national park 21 civilian conservation corps north rim road national park service national register of historic places 22 biology edit the black canyon of the gunnison national park contains a wide variety of flora and fauna. some common plants native to the park include  aspen ponderosa pine sagebrush mahogany cercocarpus utah juniper gambel oak scrub oak single-leaf ash 23 black canyon gilia aliciella penstemonoides 24 coyote elk magpie eagle mule deer great horned owl american dipper steller\'s jay mountain bluebird peregrine falcon white-throated swift canyon wren 25 attractions edit an estimated 250,000 tourists visit the park annually. the main attraction of the park is the scenic drive along us highway 50 and colorado highway 92, as well as the south rim. the west end of the park, where it meet blue mesa reservoir at blue mesa point, is the area most developed for camping. it includes tent camping and rv parking with full hookups as well as canyon tours, hiking, fishing and boat tours. the west end of the park has river access by automobile, as well as guided tours of the canyon. a short hike at blue mesa point information center heads down to pine creek and the morrow point boat tours, boating, fishing and hiking. at the south rim there are two  campgrounds hiking m) in length. the river can also be accessed by steep, unmaintained trails called routes or draws on the north and south rim. these routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up, depending on which route is taken. all inner canyon descents are strenuous and require class 3 climbing and basic route finding skills. steep talus, impassable ledges, and lack of cover are some of the challenges hikers are faced with. poison ivy also grows abundantly in the draws and on the canyon floor. long sleeves and hiking boots are strongly recommended. the flow rate of the gunnison river should also be considered for those planning on camping in the canyon, as high river levels can wash out the camp sites. the national park service warns the following: "routes are difficult to follow, and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes 26 the gunnison river is designated as a gold medal water from 200 yards downstream of crystal reservoir dam to the north fork. this includes the 12 miles within the black canyon of the gunnison national park. only artificial flies and lures are permitted, and all rainbow trout are catch and release. additionally, fishing is prohibited within 200 yards downstream of crystal dam. 27 the black canyon is a center for  rock climbing traditional climbing 28 rafting opportunities exist in the region, but the run through the park itself is a difficult technical run for only the best kayakers. there are several impassable stretches of water requiring long, sometimes dangerous portages. the remaining rapids are class iii - v, and are only for expert river runners. 29 30 31 references edit 2012-03-06 2015-06-16 a b vandenbusche, duane (2009).  images of america - the black canyon of the gunnison 7.  isbn 978-0-7385-6919-2 help a b 2007-07-29 2006-10-27 2006-10-27 tweto, o (1980).  colorado geology 3746. a b c trista thornberry-ehrlich (2005).  pdf 2006-10-27 2007-07-29 2014-07-28 2014-06-24 1. help vandenbusche, duane (2009).  images of america - the black canyon of the gunnison 8.  isbn 978-0-7385-6919-2 help 2007-07-29 kipling, rudyard (1900).  from sea to sea, and other sketches isbn 978-1596058248 2014-07-29 athearn, robert (1977).  the denver and rio grande western railroad isbn 0-8032-0920-7 frank, jerritt (2003-01-01).

but it is common at higher elevations, especially at crater lake. measurements at park headquarters, 6,475 feet (1,974 m) above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in oregon. winter, which typically begins at the park in september and runs through june, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. up to 37 inches (94 cm) of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), 313 inches (800 cm) in a month (january 1950), and 903 inches (2,290 cm) in a year (1950). 6 snow typically accumulates in the park to depths of 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) by early spring. most of the park\'s roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. in july and august, snowfall is uncommon, and "one magnificent day typically follows another". 7 january is the coldest month, when highs average about 35 f (2 c) and lows average about 18 f (8 c). 8 f (21 c) and an average low of about 40 f

very thick layer of  pumice regolith the pinnacles: when the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed 200-to-300-foot (60 to 90 m) thick gas-charged deposits. for perhaps years

national park is reached by train on the southern pacific railroad lines into medford and klamath falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. a hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. for the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the pacific and dalles-california highways. he will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. the park is open to travel from late june or july 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until october. 15 the lake is described in the poetry of  joaquin miller 16

2.5-mile (4.0 km) hike from the rim drive trailhead. on a clear day visibility from the summit exceeds 100 miles (160 km), and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. also visible from this point are the white-peaked  cascade range volcanoes columbia river plateau klamath mountains the scenery of crater lake is fully accessible during the summer months. heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular "rim drive", which is generally completely open from july to october, and partially open in some other months, such as may, june, and november. trails edit cleetwood cove edit the cleetwood cove trail is one of the several walk trails that originate from the rim drive. it drops 700 feet (210 m) from the cleetwood cove parking lot. first opened during the summer of 1960 it is the only trail that accesses directly to the lake. 19 wheelchair accessible the watchman edit the watchman trail begins from the watchman overlook parking lot, built in the 1930s. the trail is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long and 700 feet (210 m) vertical. 20 mount mcloughlin mount thielsen union peak mount scott klamath

several meadows up to the lightning spring creek. the trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer. castle crest wildflower garden edit this is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the castle crest wildflower garden. it starts from the east rim road, near the park\'s headquarters. it received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with  wildflowers 1 2 m) before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart. plaikni falls edit the plaikni falls trail is the newest trail on the crater lake park. it stretches 1.1 miles (1.8 km) from the trailhead located 1.2 miles (1.9 km) south from the phantom ship overlook on pinnacles road, which spins off rim drive. the trail leads to the plaikni falls. most of the trail is wheelchair accessible. the final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging. garfield peak edit phantom ship the  garfield peak km) hike to garfield summit. the trailhead is located east of the crater lake lodge and gains approximately 1,000 feet (300 m) of elevation. several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the phantom ship island and dutton cliff. a few viewpoints offer unique views of wizard island. the trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings. see also edit environment portal oregon portal list of nationally protected areas of the united states national park service rustic national register of historic places

than 11,000 years before the present, with documented sites just outside park boundaries dated to more than 8,000 years before present. however, relatively few archaeological sites have been documented within the park boundaries, owing to the region\'s high elevation, with harsh winter conditions and scarce resources compared to lower elevations in the area. the oldest site within park boundaries is the teklanika river site, dated to about 7130 bp. more than 84 archaeological sites have been documented within the park. the sites are typically characterized as hunting camps rather than settlements, and provide little cultural context. the presence of  athabaskan koyukon tanana dena\'ina 3 polychrome mountains establishment of the park edit in 1906, conservationist  charles

feet (5,500 m) is the highest of any mountain in the world. the mountain is still gaining about 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in height each year due to the continued convergence of the  north american pacific plates granite there are three major rock provinces that run in east-west bands through the park. the oldest is in the north, and the younger ones in the south. citation needed terranes the oldest rocks in the park are part of the yukon-tanana terrane. they originated from ocean sediments deposited between 400 million and 1 billion years ago. the original rocks have been affected by the processes of regional metamorphism, folding, and faulting to form rocks such as  schist quartzite phyllite slate marble limestone the next oldest group of rocks is the farewell terrane. it is composed of rocks from the  paleozoic era the pingston, mckinley, and chulitna terranes are the next oldest; they were deposited in the  mesozoic era marble chert limestone shale sandstone igneous gabbro diabase diorite pillow basalts some of the youngest rocks in the park include the kahlitna terrane, which is a flysch sequence (a sedimentary rock sequence deposited in a marine environment during the

semicircular basins called  cirques arte col horn glaciers deposit rock fragments, but the most notable of the depositions are the erratics, which are large rock fragments carried some distance from the source, found on glacial terraces and ridge tops in many places throughout denali. headquarter erratics are made of granite and can be the size of a house. some erratics (like those from the yanert valley) are located 30 miles (48 km) away from their original location. ruth glacier large amounts of rock debris are carried on, in, and beneath the ice as the glaciers move downslope. lateral moraines are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride along the edge of the moving glaciers. when  lateral moraines medial moraines braided meltwater streams heavily loaded with rock debris continually shift and intertwine their channels over valley floors. valley trains are built up as streams drop quantities of poorly sorted sediment. valley trains are long, narrow

permafrost mm) to 10 feet (3.0 m) thick. the permafrost layer below the active layer has been measured to be between 30 and 100 feet (9.1 and 30.5 m) deep depending on the location of measurement in the park. a stand of white spruce growing on a lower slope of denali is called the  drunken forest shallow ponds in denali are known as thaw lakes and cave-in lakes. they form where sunwarmed water has melted basins in the underlying permafrost. they deepen gradually in the summer months depending on the temperature variance. if the temperature is high enough, the thaw lakes and cave-in lakes will enlarge as their rims collapse. ice has 10 percent greater volume than water, so it continues to exert pressure on the ground. thermal expansion and contraction can cause cracks to develop in the permafrost. during the thaw season in the freeze-thaw cycle, water gets into the cracks and forms veins of ice called ice wedges. ice wedges enlarge with successive seasons of freezing and thawing.

dry tortugas, which has limited resources for such arrivals and which is several hours from the nearest coast guard or border patrol units. communications with key west are accomplished using a satellite-based voice-over-ip system, which is prone to garbling and delays, and by a radio relay system using an abandoned air force tower between key west and the dry tortugas. 14 visitation

years before the present, with archaeological sites just outside the park dating to that time. evidence of human activity is scarce, because so much of the area is or was glaciated for much of the period and because advancing glaciers may have scoured all traces of historical occupation from their valleys. ongoing uplift of the land may reveal new sites that had been submerged by rising sea levels. most archaeological evidence is from the last 200 years. the  haida eyak tlingit 11 jean-franois de galaup, comte de laprouse lituya bay george vancouver discovery vancouver expedition 11 19

water could suffer due to a loss of habitat. reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires. the loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors. 52 climate edit big drift going-to-the-sun road as the park spans the

cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. this approach is common to many other protected areas. as part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant. dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year. 83 km 2 84 km 2 5 recreation edit glacier is distant from major cities.

orogenies mafic rhyolitic extensive volcanism also occurred during the middle to late cambrian, contributing further to the uplift of the area. this also contributed to a second round of block faulting, in which  conglomerates snake range 11 12 both continuous and intermittent fault movements also occurred, with individual fault surfaces on both sides of the snake range thinning and stretching. 12 glaciation glaciation pleistocene cirques moraines 12 lehman caves the lehman cave system began forming approximately 550 million years ago (during the cambrian) while it was still submerged in a relatively warm, shallow ocean. the caves are made up of a marble and limestone solution, for the most part, that forms the many cave decorations throughout the caverns. 11 the cave system became much deeper during the pleistocene, when a prolonged and increased flow of water eroded through the cave\'s fracturing bedrock. eventually, the water level dropped, leaving glare rooms and cavities in the rock, creating the depths of the lehman caves system. 11 scenic features edit the park\'s scenic features include lexington arch, the  lehman orchard and aqueduct rhodes cabin

external links natural history edit sangre de cristo range the park contains the tallest  sand dunes north america m) from the floor of the  san luis valley sangre de cristo range ha). researchers say that the dunes started forming less than 440,000 years ago. the dunes were formed from sand and soil deposits of the  rio grande tributaries flood plain 4 there are several streams flowing on the perimeter of the dunes. the streams erode the edge of the dune field, and sand is carried downstream. the water disappears into the ground, depositing sand on the surface. winds pick up the deposits of sand, and blow them up onto the dune field once again. digging a couple inches into the dunes even at their peaks reveals wet sand. part of the motivation of turning the monument into a national park was the extra protection of the water, which colorado\'s cities and agriculture covet. it is very easy to experience the dune-building process. this is a very windy region, as hikers on the sand dunes will attest, as on many days they will be pelted by sand and even small rocks when hiking on the dunes. the wind carries sand and rocks from many miles away. while the dunes don\'t change location or size that often, there are still parabolic dunes that start in the sand sheet, the outer area around the dunes, and migrate towards the main dune field. sometimes they join the main dune field, and sometimes they will get covered with grass and vegetation and remain where they are. the dunes are relatively stable, however their morphology changes slightly with the seasons. the direction of the wind greatly affects the dune type. the winds normally go from southwest to northeast, however during the late summer months, the wind direction reverses causing reversing dunes. this wind regime is part of the reason why the dunes are so tall. the dunes contain areas of black sand which are deposits of  magnetite crystalline oxide iron climate edit the great sand dunes sit on a large area of "high desert" land in the  san luis valley sangre de cristo mountains f (35 c) are not uncommon in july and august. the large variation between high and low temperatures are typical of the high desert climate. low temperatures during winter nights can be exceedingly cold, with several night temperatures dropping below 0 f (18 c) in the winter. further off of the great sand dunes in this high desert valley, precipitation numbers are exceedingly low. however, precipitation is still very low on the great sand dunes, averaging just above 11 inches (280 mm) of rainfall per year. the high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as desert land still, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250 mm). it does snow on the dunes as well, but snowfall is usually very short-lived in the dry and sunny climate that is common in this area of colorado. climate data for great sand dunes national park and preserve month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec

edit the park also contains alpine lakes and  tundra over 13,000 feet spruce pine aspen cottonwood grasslands wetlands one of the most unusual features of the park happens at medano creek, which borders the east side of the dunes and is located next to the visitor center and bookstore. because fresh sand continually falls in the creek, medano creek never finds a permanent and stable streambed. small underwater sand dunes that act like dams continually form and break down, and so waders in the stream see surgeswhich look like wavesof water flowing downstream at intervals of anywhere from just a few seconds to a minute or more. in a high-water year, these surges can be as much as a foot in height, resembling  ocean waves zapata falls one of the most valued features of the great sand dunes national park and preserve is one that cannot be seen. according to a recent soundscape study conducted by the national park service, this park is the quietest national park in the 48 contiguous united states. many visitors to the site try to sled down the dunes. the park service provides hints as to the best time to sled (when the sand is wet) and which equipment works best. visitors anytime other than late fall through early spring are also advised to avoid bare feet or sandals, and stick with sturdy, closed footwear. while the sand looks alluring, its chocolate color absorbs heat. the daylight sand temperature can reach 140 f (60 c) and will burn bare feet. plants and animals edit there are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. trees include  douglass fir pinyon pine aspen rocky mountain juniper three-leaf sumac bristlecone pine red osier dogwood 6 among the flowering plants are  alpine phlox dwarf clover alpine forget-me-not fairy primrose alpine aven indian paintbrush lousewort blue-purple penstemon aspen daisy western paintbrush elephantella snow

the park is undoubtedly the famous haleakal crater. it is huge: 6.99 miles (11.25 km) across, 2.0 mi (3.2 km) wide, and some 2,600 ft (790 m) deep. the interior of the crater is dotted by numerous volcanic features, including large  cinder cones each morning, visitors come to the summit of the volcano to watch the spectacular sunrise. more visitors come each afternoon to watch the equally amazing sunset. in either case conditions can be extremely cold. one attraction of the park is  hosmer\'s grove cedrus deodara himalayas cryptomeria japonica japan eucalyptus australia north america

believed for centuries to possess medicinal properties, and was a subject of legend among several native american tribes. following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. incorporated january 10, 1851, the city has been home to major league baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as al capone, horse racing at oaklawn park, the army and navy hospital, and 42nd president bill clinton. the area was made a national park on march 4, 1921. 3 us quarter america the beautiful quarters the hot springs flow from the western slope of hot springs mountain, part of the  ouachita mountain following 8,000 years of use by indigenous peoples, european americans discovered and appropriated the springs. they have used the hot spring water

william dunbar george hunter 4 on august 24, 1818, the quapaw indians ceded the land around the hot springs to the united states in a treaty after having been forced to a reservation south of the site. 4 indian territory 22nd united states congress 5 6 hot springs reservation 4 national park edit although hot springs national park is the oldest park managed by the national park system, by act of congress in 1922, the site\'s name was officially changed from the hot springs reservation to the  hot springs national park 7 ha), including hot springs mountain, north mountain, west mountain, sugar-loaf mountain and whittington lake park. it later was expanded to 5,000 acres (2,000 ha). the springs are all grouped about the base of the hot springs mountain, with a flow of well over a half million gallons a day. the hot water is supplied to the various bathhouses, with resulting income from concession fees going to the u.s. treasury. the park has miles of roads and trails over the mountains. the park is open throughout the year. 8 the first bathhouses were little more than brush huts and log cabins placed over excavations cut in the rocks to receive hot water that flowed from the springs. entrepreneurs soon developed more elaborate bathing facilities, featuring wooden troughs delivering water from hillside springs to bathhouses along the east bank of hot springs creek. some of the tufa covering the hillside was excavated to accommodate the bathhouses. the narrow street along the west side of the creek was connected to the bathhouses by narrow bridges. after direct federal supervision was exercised beginning in 1877, major improvements were made. the creek was covered with stone arches, and above it a street 100 feet wide was built. all the squatters were evicted, rubbish cleaned up, and a centralized plumbing system was begun. 9 10 the park operates a public campground at gulpha gorge, about two miles (3 km) from downtown hot springs. city of hot springs edit main article:  hot springs, arkansas the city of hot springs (incorporated 1851) is governed under state and municipal law. in the 1870s, african americans in town were concentrated in happy valley, north of hot springs mountain. there were churches of various denominations, including baptist for white and black congregations. 11 the national park service exercises no control or supervision over any matters connected with the city. the city starts on the other side of central avenue from bathhouse row. its development has extended beyond the narrow valley in which the springs are located, spreading out over the open plain to the south and east. the climate is good throughout the year. the elevation of the city is 600 feet (180 m) above sea level, with surrounding hills rising another 600 feet. in the first half of the 20th century, the city operated primarily as a summer resort, but hotels have now long stayed open during the winter due to many northerly patrons coming to escape the winter cold. 8 during the peak popularity of the hot springs, until the 1950s, the many patients staying for three weeks, six weeks, or longer were a large source of business for the numerous hotels, boarding houses, doctors, and drugstores. as the daily treatments required only an hour or two, the visitors\' idle time created opportunities for other businesses in the town. 11 bathing customs edit it was believed the waters benefited diseases of the skin and blood, nervous affections, rheumatism and kindred diseases, and the "various diseases of women". in the case of  tuberculosis 4 8 11 the earliest bathing procedure consisted of merely reclining in natural pools of hot springs and cool creek water for long periods of time. during the 1820s crude vapor baths stood over the springs, and bathers breathed in the vapors for extended periods of time. wooden tubs were added to some bathhouses in the 1830s. physicians began arriving in the 1850s, although many visitors did without their services; visitors remained from one week to two months. after the civil war a tub bath of 15 to 20 minutes was common. 4 during the 1870s the bathing regimen became more diverse, and physicians prescribed various types of baths for patients. the period of time for tub baths became six to ten minutes and the time in the steam bath shortened to two minutes, with only one bath a day. 4 the treatment was by drinking and bathing in the waters, producing a profuse perspiration, which was considered an active agent in fighting disease. the advice of a physician who was familiar with the use of the waters was considered necessary to avoid injury. in many cases medicine was required before using the waters, although it had been observed that the amount of drugs given was "enough to sicken a well man." 8 11 the hot baths were usually taken once a day for three weeks, when a rest was necessary (often with a week at the sulphur springs near the ouachita river). a second three weeks\' course was then taken, followed again by an abstinence from bathing for several days. the usual stay at the springs was from one to three months, but many invalids stayed a year and longer. 11 the process described in 1878 was a hot bath of 90 to 95 f (32 to 35 c) for about 3 minutes (timed with a sand-glass). this was followed by another three minutes with all but the head in a steam box, or if milder treatment was prescribed, sitting atop the steam box covered with a blanket. during this the bather is also drinking hot water from their coffee-pot. after these eight to ten minutes of treatment, the bather is well rubbed down and thoroughly dried. the blanket-covered customer then would walk briskly back to their quarters to lie down for at least a half hour to let the body recover its normal temperature. sleeping at this stage was considered dangerous. 11 the bathhouses began using vapor cabinets around 1884. the bather sat in the cabinet for 1020 minutes with the lid closed tightly around the neck, with vapor from the hot water rising through the floor of the cabinet, with temperatures around 110130 f (4354 c). toward the end of the 1880s  russian turkish baths 4 although details of services were left to bathhouse operators, the park\'s superintendent set various rules. in the 1930s a tub bath could not take more than 20 minutes and shower no more than 90 seconds. during the next decade shower time was reduced to a minute, with maximum temperatures specified for several services. after a bath of about 98 f (37 c), the patient might spend 25 minutes in a vapor cabinet, get 15 minutes of packs (wet, hot or cold), followed by a tepid needle shower and light massage and alcohol rub. 4 by 1980 one reporter described getting a 20-minute bath, two minutes in a steam bath, 15 minutes wrapped with hot packs, and resting in a cooling room for 2030 minutes. 4 the current modern facilities are oriented toward spa style or pool services. lamar bathhouse ozark bathhouse buckstaff bathhouse quapaw bathhouse pay bathhouses edit there have been nearly two dozen pay bathhouses operating at the same time, with about nine of those within the park\'s "bathhouse row." (facilities have been reworked over the years, and the quapaw operate a bath incorporating two previously separate bathhouses). nine of the bathhouses were associated with hotels, hospitals, or sanatoria. the water is the same for all, but the prices charged for the baths have varied according to the equipment, accommodations and services offered by each facility. the charges for the services of the attendants are the same and include the necessities except towels, blankets, bathrobes, laundering, rubbing mercury, and handling of invalids. the area was popular with baseball players in the early 20th century, and was used by some teams for spring training. in 1929, prices for single baths ranged from $1 to $1.40, while a course of 21 baths was $16 to $24. facilities were segregated until civil rights legislation in the 1960s. baths were offered for whites at the  arlington hotel 8 at present on bathhouse row only the buckstaff and quapaw are operating as bathhouses. the fordyce is open as a visitors center; its staff gives tours of the facilities that have been historically renovated to their original appearance. the ozark is housing the museum of contemporary art; its space can be rented as reception hall. the arlington hotel, austin hotel and convention center, and the springs hotel  fordyce bathhouse maurice bathhouse hale and superior bathhouses national baptist hotel and sanitorium (bathhouse for \'colored peoples\') army and navy hospital edit the army and navy general hospital (now the rehabilitation center) was also supplied with water from the springs. it is located behind the south end of bathhouse row along the base of hot springs mountain. it was administered by the war department for the benefit of military members, officers of the public health service, and honorably discharged veterans. the waters of the hot springs had an established reputation in benefiting. admission to the hospital was reserved for cases "of a serious and obstinate character, which, though resisting ordinary methods of relief, were promised a rapid and permanent recovery from the use of the waters of the spring." 8 the facility now known as the hot springs rehabilitation center was built in 1933 as the second army-navy hospital. it has been used and operated by the state for over 50 years. 12 national register of historic places disasters edit

central portion of the city along hot springs creek) was burned - presumably by union troops. as in many other cities, fire has been a risk, especially before city services were developed. on march 5, 1878 a large fire burned for eight hours in the city, claiming nearly 150 buildings, including hotels, bath houses, and restaurants. on february 26, 1905, a fire started in the grand central hotel on chapel street and burned 25 blocks of the southern section of hot springs. on september 5, 1913, a laundry worker was ironing and accidentally started a fire at 424 church street, which spread rapidly due to strong winds and burned nearly 60 blocks of the south part of the city. the city has also been subject to flooding because of the narrow valley. on may 14, 1923, a severe rainstorm hit the city. with mountains surrounding three sides of the city, water flooded down the slopes of the mountains, funneling to central avenue and reaching a depth of nine feet. a lightning strike during the storm caused a fire that destroyed several commercial businesses in downtown hot springs. on february 15, 1956, a severe flood filled central avenue with three feet of rushing water, causing significant property damage. in may 1990, a series of storms dropped more than 13 inches (330 mm) of rain into the city, causing flash floods. a wave of water six feet high washed through downtown hot springs, causing extensive damage. during the flood, carpenter dam bridge was washed away. on february 27, 2014, fire broke out at the majestic hotel on park ave. just outside the boundaries of the national park caught fire. it took 75 firefighters over 22 hours to extinguish the blaze in the oldest section of the hotel, and in the end the building was a total loss. just days later, the city of hot springs had the building razed. it was believed that trespassers had started the blaze. government free baths edit congress established a free bathhouse for the indigent here on december 16, 1878.

a gap between hot springs mountain and west mountain in an area about 1,500 feet (460 m) long by 400 feet (120 m) wide at altitudes from 576 to 683 feet (176 to 208 m). the springs predominantly are composed of hot water from thousands of feet underground mixed with some shallow cold ground water. currently, there are 43 thermal springs in the park that are presumed to be flowing. thermal water from 33 of the thermal springs is collected and monitored at a central reservoir, which distributes the combined discharge for public use and consumption. rock types in the area include  shale chert novaculite sandstone 15 the water comes from rain which falls in mountains to the north and northeast. flowing downward through cracked rock at about one foot per year, the meteoric water migrates to estimated minimum depths of 4,500 to 7,500 ft (1,400 to 2,300 m) and achieves high temperatures in the deep section of the flow path before rising along fault and fracture conduits. under artesian pressure, the thermal waters rise and emerge through the hot springs sandstone between the traces of two thrust faults, along several northeast-trending lineaments. some rainwater from near the springs mixes with the deep hot water before discharge. the trip down takes about 4,000 years while the hot water takes about a year to reach the surface. 9 the heat comes from  the natural heating of rocks as depth increases alkaline 9 rock types edit the exposed rock types in the vicinity of the thermal springs are  sedimentary rocks mississippian ordovician igneous rocks cretaceous km) southeast of the thermal springs (potash sulphur spring and  magnet cove dikes sills ft (1.5 m) wide. there have been 80 dikes noted about 4 miles (6.4 km) southeast of hot springs, on and near the  ouachita river the sedimentary rocks in the vicinity of the thermal springs consist of shale, chert, novaculite, sandstone, and conglomerate. the stanley shale is predominantly a  clayey feldspathic silty the hot springs sandstone member of the stanley shale, hereafter referred to as the hot springs sandstone, consists of fine- to medium-grained sandstone with some shale and conglomerate. the sandstone is gray, hard and  quartzitic ft (1.8 m) the shale predominantly occurs at the top of the unit, and the principal bed of the conglomerate occurs at the bottom. the arkansas novaculite consists of lower, middle, and upper members. the lower member is a massive fractured novaculite, and is the dominant member on hot springs mountain, with a thickness of about 275 ft (84 m) the middle member is a black clay shale interbedded with novaculite, about 10 ft (3.0 m) thick on hot springs mountain. the upper member is chiefly a massive, highly calcareous light gray to black novaculite. it reaches a maximum thickness of 180 ft (55 m) in the area. the polk creek shale and missouri mountain shale overlie the bigfork chert and generally consist of shale with minor thin layers of quartzitic sandstone. the polk creek shale is a black, fissile,  graphitic argillaceous the bigfork chert overlies the womble shale and consists almost entirely of chert and silty chert in layers 2 to 12 inches (51 to 305 mm) thick, separated by minor thin beds of black shale. the chert is very brittle and intensely fractured from folding. the womble shale is the oldest geologic unit that underlies all other exposed units. it is black, hard, and argillaceous shale. 15 during most of the  paleozoic south american plate north american plate 4 anticline thrust faults ft (2,800 m) onto the southeast flank of north mountain, and  dips ft (2,700 m) roughly along the axis of the hot springs anticline, and dips about 44 degrees north. it has been proposed that a fault splits away from the southern fault, trends west and connects with the northern fault. a natural ravine trends along the location of this fault. extensive cracks, joints, and fissures in the bigfork chert, arkansas novaculite, and the hot springs sandstone allow the water to flow in the thermal springs area. 15 travertine tufa rock 4 composition of the water edit the water all comes from the same deep source, but surface appearance of the springs differed. what was called mud spring had a tepid ooze where there was no danger of being scalded. springs acquired names such as magnesia, big iron, and arsenic. big iron\'s water, with significant dissolved iron, would precipitate ocherous crusts and stains. 11 that substance ml) a day. the temperature averages about 143 f (62 c). maximum temperatures have declined about 5 f (2.8 c)

surrounding lands became appreciated for their abundance of sockeye salmon, the grizzly bears that fed upon them, and a wide variety of other alaskan wildlife and marine life. after a series of boundary expansions, the present national park and preserve were established in 1980 under the  alaska national interest lands conservation act contents 1 geography 1.1 volcanoes 2 activities 3

led to some problems about bear hunting due to small preserve population sizes and stalking bears to close limits. 5 6 the foundation rocks on the alaska peninsula are divided by the bruin bay fault into fossiliferous sedimentary rocks of jurassic and cretaceous age to the east and metamorphic and igneous rocks to the west. the granite aleutian range  batholith moraines peat permafrost 7 two physiographic provinces cover the park. the aleutian range province is composed of the shelikof strait coastline, about 10 miles (16 km) deep along the coast, the aleutian mountain zone, and the lake, or hudsonian zone. farther west the nushagak-bristol bay lowlands province is separated from the aleutian zone by the bruin bay fault, occupying a small corner of the park. 8 volcanoes edit the active volcanoes in the park are  mount katmai novarupta trident volcano mount mageik mount martin fourpeaked mountain mount douglas mount griggs snowy mountain mount denison mount kukak devils desk mount kaguyak 9 7 the most significant volcanic event in historical times was the simultaneous eruption of mount katmai and novarupta in june 1912. novarupta\'s eruption produced a  pyroclastic flow m) thick. at the same time the summit of katmai collapsed into a caldera. as the valley deposits cooled, they emitted steam from fissures and fumaroles, earning the name " valley of ten thousand smokes m) deep, but only 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3.0 m) wide. 7 stratovolcano m) in height, with a large summit caldera. several glaciers originate from the mountain, and one in the caldera is the only glacier

historic places national historic landmark old savonoski site dil-161 site alagnak river russians and americans edit russians were the first europeans to arrive in the area in significant numbers, trading in furs. they encountered the aglegmuit eskimos on the bristol bay side of the peninsula and the koniag eskino on the shelikov strait side. katmai village was the only location within the park where europeans lived through the mid-19th century, though their numbers were always few. in the latter part of the 19th century a few villages were established inland at severnosky and along the coast at douglas and kukak. american traders operating for the alaska commercial company took the place of the russians. as sea otters became scarce the trade dried up, and katmai and douglas were abandoned in the early 20th century. in the 1890s the region was a route for travelers going to  nome rex beach the silver horde 8 pyroclastic flow by 1898 there were reports of frequent earthquakes in the vicinity of katmai pass. these intensified around june 1, 1912, inducing the few local residents to leave. katmai and novarupta erupted on june 6 with a noise heard in fairbanks, 500 miles (800

fell on the alaskan mainland and eastwards as far as puget sound. atmospheric haze was noted worldwide, and temperatures were depressed in the northern hemisphere during the second half of 1912. initial reports pinpointed mount katmai as the center of eruption. later reports cast doubt on katmai\'s primary role, and it was not until 1954 that novarupta was found to be the primary volcanic

officials. a 1923 expedition found that the region had little exploitable mineral potential. tourists in the early 1920s amounted to a few dozen. no park service staff were assigned to the site, which was in theory administered by mount mckinley. by 1928 more visitors arrived. the most prominent among them was father  bernard r. hubbard herbert hoover ha), more than doubling it in size and creating the largest single park service unit. crucially, the expanded monument included the falls at brooks camp, while avoiding lands along the coast thought to have potential oil deposits. 43 in 1937 a

territorial interests sought to have the monument disestablished or reduced in size to allow mining and fishing, because the activity at the valley of ten thousand smokes had declined, and because the park service had made no effort to develop the monument for visitors. these proposals were turned aside, and in 1950 a seasonal ranger was assigned to katmai. 43 mission 66 1964 alaska earthquake ha)

sandstone epikarstic zone caprock human-explorable caves the limestone layers of the  stratigraphic girkin formation ste. genevieve limestone st. louis limestone the bottomless pit in mammoth cave each of the primary layers of limestone is divided further into named geological units and subunits. one area of cave research involves correlating the stratigraphy with the cave survey produced by explorers. this makes it possible to produce approximate three-dimensional maps of the contours of the various layer boundaries without the necessity for test wells and extracting core samples. the upper sandstone caprock is relatively hard for water to penetrate: the exceptions are where vertical cracks occur. this protective role means that many of the older, upper passages of the cave system are very dry, with no  stalactites stalagmites however, the sandstone caprock layer has been dissolved and eroded at many locations within the park, such as the frozen niagara room. the "contact" between limestone and sandstone can be found by hiking from the valley bottoms to the ridgetops: typically, as one approaches the top of a ridge, one sees the outcrops of exposed rock change in composition from limestone to sandstone at a well-defined elevation. 6 at one valley bottom in the southern region of the park, a massive  sinkhole cedar sink mammoth cave is home to the  endangered

the tour was discontinued for logistic and environmental reasons in the early 1990s. 7 mammoth cave headquarters and visitor\'s center is located on  mammoth cave parkway kentucky route 70 kentucky

purposeful burial was discovered when in 1935 the remains of an adult male were discovered under a large boulder. the boulder had shifted and settled onto the victim, a pre-columbian miner, who had disturbed the rubble supporting it. the remains of the ancient victim were named "lost john" and exhibited to the public into the 1970s, when they were interred in a secret location in mammoth cave for reasons of preservation as well as emerging political sensitivities with respect to the public display of native american remains. research beginning in the late 1950s led by  patty jo watson washington university st. louis, missouri archaic woodland peoples carbon dates hunter-gatherer plant domestication agriculture another technique employed in  archaeological research experimental archaeology ancient human remains and artifacts within the caves are protected by various federal and state laws. one of the most basic facts to be determined about a newly discovered artifact is its precise location and situation. even slightly moving a prehistoric artifact contaminates it from a research perspective. explorers are properly trained not to disturb archaeological evidence, and some areas of the cave remain out-of-bounds for even seasoned explorers, unless the subject of the trip is archaeological research on that area. besides the remains that have been discovered in the portion of the cave accessible through the historic entrance of mammoth cave, the remains of cane torches used by native americans, as well as other artifacts such as drawings, gourd fragments, and woven grass moccasin slippers are found in the salts cave section of the system in flint ridge. though there is undeniable proof of their existence and use of the cave, there is no evidence of further use past the archaic period. experts and scientists have no answer as to why this is, making it one of the greatest mysteries of mammoth cave to this day. earliest known history edit the 31,000-acre (13,000 ha) tract known as the "pollard survey" was sold by  indenture 10, 1791 in  philadelphia ha) of the "pollard survey" between the north bank of  bacon creek green river thomas lang, jr. yorkshire 3, 1796, for 4,116/13s/0d (4,116.65). the land was lost to a local county tax claim during the  war of 1812 legend has it that the first european to discover mammoth cave was either john houchin or his brother francis houchin, in 1797. while hunting, houchin pursued a wounded bear to the cave\'s large entrance opening near the green river. some houchin family tales have john decatur "johnny dick" houchin as the discoverer of the cave, but this is highly unlikely because johnny dick was only 10 years old in 1797 and was unlikely to be out hunting bears at such a tender age. his father john is the more likely candidate from that branch of the family tree, but the most probable candidate for discoverer of mammoth cave is francis "frank" houchin whose land was much closer to the cave entrance than his brother john\'s. there is also the argument that their brother charles houchin, who was known as a great hunter and trapper, was the man who shot that bear and chased it into the cave. the shadow over charles\'s claim is the fact that he was residing in illinois until 1801. contrary to this story is brucker and watson\'s  the longest cave the land containing this historic entrance was first surveyed and registered in 1798 under the name of valentine simons. simons began exploiting mammoth cave for its  saltpeter according to family records passed down through the houchin, and later henderson families, john houchin was bear hunting and the bear turned and began to chase him. he found the cave entrance when he ran into the cave for protection from the charging bear. 19th century edit in partnership with valentine simon, various other individuals would own the land through the  war of 1812 british in july 1812, the cave was purchased from simon and other owners by charles wilkins and an investor from philadelphia named hyman gratz. soon the cave was being mined for  calcium nitrate a half-interest in the cave changed hands for ten thousand dollars (a huge sum at the time). after the war when prices fell, the workings were abandoned and it became a minor tourist attraction centering on a  native american mummy when wilkins died his estate\'s executors sold his interest in the cave to gratz. in the spring of 1838, the cave was sold by the gratz brothers to franklin gorin, who intended to operate mammoth cave purely as a tourist attraction, the bottom long having since fallen out of the saltpeter market. gorin was a slave owner, and used his slaves as tour guides. one of these slaves would make a number of important contributions to human knowledge of the cave, and become one of mammoth cave\'s most celebrated historical figures. stephen bishop african-american slave maps stephen bishop was introduced to mammoth cave in 1838 by franklin gorin. gorin wrote, after bishop\'s death: "i placed a guide in the cave the celebrated and great stephen, and he aided in making the discoveries. he was the first person who ever crossed the bottomless pit, and he, myself and another person whose name i have forgotten were the only persons ever at the bottom of gorin\'s dome to my knowledge. 9 in 1839,  john croghan louisville tuberculosis throughout the 19th century, the fame of mammoth cave would grow so that the cave became an international sensation. at the same time, the cave attracted the attention of 19th century writers such as  robert montgomery bird nathaniel parker willis bayard taylor john muir 10 edwin booth john wilkes booth assassinated abraham lincoln jenny lind 5, 1851), and violinist  ole bull by 1859, when the  louisville and nashville railroad park city mammoth cave railroad early 20th century: the kentucky cave wars edit the difficulties of farming life in the hardscrabble, poor soil of the cave country influenced local owners of smaller nearby caves to see opportunities for commercial exploitation, particularly given the success of mammoth cave as a tourist attraction. the "kentucky cave wars" were a period of bitter competition between local cave owners for tourist money. broad tactics of deception were used to lure visitors away from their intended destination to other private show caves. misleading signs were placed along the roads leading to the mammoth cave. a typical strategy during the early days of automobile travel involved representatives (known as "cappers") of other private show caves hopping aboard a tourist\'s car\'s running board, and leading the passengers to believe that mammoth cave was closed, quarantined, caved in or otherwise inaccessible. in 1906, mammoth cave became accessible by  steamboat brownsville, kentucky in 1909,  max kmper the croghan family suppressed the topographic element of kmper\'s map, and it is not known to survive today, although the cave map portion of kmper\'s work stands as a triumph of accurate cave cartography: not until the early 1960s and the advent of the modern exploration period would these passages be surveyed and mapped with greater accuracy. kmper returned to berlin, and from the point of view of the mammoth cave country, disappeared entirely. it was not until the turn of the 21st century that a group of german tourists, after visiting the cave, researched kmper\'s family and determined his fate: the young kmper was killed in  trench warfare battle of the somme famed french cave explorer  douard-alfred martel 11 in the early 1920s, george morrison created, via blasting, a number of entrances to mammoth cave on land not owned by the croghan estate. absent the data from the croghan\'s secretive surveys, performed by kmper, bishop, and others, which had not been published in a form suitable for determining the geographic extent of the cave, it was now conclusively shown that the croghans had been for years exhibiting portions of mammoth cave which were not under land they owned. lawsuits were filed and, for a time, different entrances to the cave were operated in direct competition with each other. in the early 20th century,  floyd collins 12 media sensation the national park movement (19261941) edit as the last of the croghan heirs died, advocacy momentum grew among wealthy citizens of kentucky for the establishment of mammoth cave national park. private citizens formed the mammoth cave national park association in 1926. the park was authorized may 25, 1926. 13 donated funds were used to purchase some farmsteads in the region, while other tracts within the proposed national park boundary were acquired by right of  eminent domain 14 for legal reasons, the federal government was prohibited from restoring or developing the cleared farmsteads while the private association held the land: this regulation was evaded by the operation of "a maximum of four"  ccc 22, 1933 to july 1942. 15 16 according to the national park service, "by may 22, 1936, 27,402 acres of land had been acquired and accepted by the secretary of the interior. the area was declared a national park on july 1, 1941 when the minimum of 45,310 acres (over 600 parcels) had been assembled." 17 superintendent hoskins later wrote of a  summer tanager 20, starting in 1938. the bird ate from food held in the hands of the guides, to the delight of visitors, and provided food to his less-tame mate. 18 birth of the national park (1941) edit mammoth cave national park was officially dedicated on july 1, 1941. by coincidence, the same year saw the incorporation of the  national speleological society the new entrance, closed to visitors since 1941, was reopened on december 26, 1951, becoming the entrance used for the beginning of the frozen niagara tour. 19 the longest cave (19541972) edit by 1954, mammoth cave national park\'s land holdings encompassed all lands within its outer boundary with the exception of two privately held tracts. one of these, the old lee collins farm, had been sold to harry thomas of horse cave, kentucky, whose grandson, william "bill" austin, operated collins crystal cave as a show cave in direct competition with the national park, which was forced to maintain roads leading to the property. condemnation and purchase of the crystal cave property seemed only a matter of time. in february 1954, a two-week expedition under the auspices of the  national speleological society 20 the c-3 expedition drew public interest, first from a photo essay published by robert halmi in the july 1954 issue of true magazine and later from the publication of a double first-person account of the expedition,  the caves beyond: the story of the collins crystal cave expedition roger brucker 21 in 1955 crystal cave was connected by survey with unknown cave, the first connection in the flint ridge system. some of the participants in the c-3 expedition wished to continue their explorations past the conclusion of the c-3 expedition, and organized as the flint ridge reconnaissance under the guidance of austin, jim dyer, john j. lehrberger and e. robert pohl. this organization was incorporated in 1957 as the  cave research foundation patty jo watson prehistory in march 1961, the crystal cave property was sold to the national park service for $285,000. 22 great onyx cave inholding colossal cave was connected by survey to salts cave in 1960 and in 1961 colossal-salts cave was similarly connected to crystal-unknown cave, creating a single cave system under much of flint ridge. by 1972, the flint ridge cave system had been surveyed to a length of 86.5 miles (139.2 km), making it the longest cave in the world. flintmammoth connection (1972) edit during the 1960s, cave research foundation (crf) exploration and mapping teams had found passageways in the flint ridge cave system that penetrated under houchins valley and came within 800 feet of known passages in mammoth cave. in 1972, crf chief cartographer john wilcox pursued an aggressive program to finally connect the caves, fielding several expeditions from the flint ridge side as well as exploring leads in mammoth cave. on a july 1972 trip deep in the flint ridge cave system,  patricia crowther with her slight frame of 115  pounds kg)crawled through a narrow canyon later dubbed the "tight spot", which acted as a filter for larger cavers. a subsequent trip past the tight spot on august 30, 1972 by wilcox, crowther, richard zopf, and tom brucker discovered the name "pete h" inscribed on the wall of a river passage with an arrow pointing in the direction of mammoth cave. 23 world war ii finally, on september 9, 1972, a six-person crf team of wilcox, crowther, zopf, gary eller, stephen wells, and cleveland pinnix (a national park service ranger) followed hanson\'s lost river downstream to discover its connection with echo river in cascade hall of mammoth cave. with this linking of the flint ridge and mammoth cave systems, the "everest of speleology" had been climbed. the integrated cave system contained 144.4 miles (232.4 km) of surveyed passages and had fourteen entrances. 24 recent discoveries edit further connections between mammoth cave and smaller caves or cave systems have followed, notably to proctor/morrison cave beneath nearby joppa ridge in 1979. proctor cave was discovered by jonathan doyle, a union army deserter during the civil war, and was later owned by the mammoth cave railroad, before being explored by the crf. morrison cave was discovered by george morrison in the 1920s. this connection pushed the frontier of mammoth exploration southeastward. at the same time, discoveries made outside the park by an independent group called the central kentucky karst coalition or ckkc resulted in the survey of tens of miles in roppel cave east of the park. discovered in 1976, roppel cave was briefly on the list of the nation\'s longest caves before it was connected to the proctor/morrison\'s section of the mammoth cave system on september 10, 1983. the connection was made by two mixed parties of crf and ckkc explorers. each party entered through a separate entrance and met in the middle before continuing in the same direction to exit at the opposite entrance. the resulting total surveyed length was near 300 miles (480 km). on march 19, 2005, a connection into the roppel cave portion of the system was surveyed from a small cave under eudora ridge, adding approximately three miles to the known length of the mammoth cave system. the newly found entrance to the cave, now termed the "hoover entrance," had been discovered in september, 2003, by alan canon and james wells. 25 km). 3 5 it is certain that many more miles of cave passages await discovery in the region. discovery of new natural entrances is a rare event: the primary mode of discovery involves the pursuit of side passages identified during routine systematic exploration of cave passages entered from known entrances. related and nearby caves edit at least two other massive cave systems lie short distances from mammoth

following species of bats inhabit the caverns:  indiana bat myotis sodalis gray bat myotis grisescens little brown bat myotis lucifugus big brown bat eptesicus fuscus eastern pipistrelle pipistrellus subflavus all together, these and more rare bat species such as the  eastern small-footed bat lasiurus borealis other animals which inhabit the caves include: two genera of crickets ( hadenoecus subterraneus ceuthophilus stygius ceuthophilus latens cave salamander eurycea lucifuga cave fish typhlichthys subterraneus amblyopsis spelaea cave crayfish orconectes pellucidus cave shrimp palaemonias ganteri in addition, some surface animals may take refuge in the entrances of the caves but do not generally venture into the deep portions of the cavern system. misconceptions related to

verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the paleo-indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. they inhabited the outlying areas of the mesa verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and  rock art chert knapping 5 by the late archaic more people were living in semi-permanent rockshelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. they started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. the late archaic is marked by

basketmaker culture basketmaker ii 7 a in addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, basketmaker ii people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. they also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than 5.5 feet (1.7 m) tall. their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. they buried the dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. basketmaker ii people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout mesa verde. they depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. a common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the  hopi kokopelli 9 c. 450 to 750 by 500 ce atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the basketmaker ii era and the beginning of the

era and the beginning of the pueblo i period. the transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. pueblo i people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called  pueblos 16 kivas m) deep and 12 to 20 feet (3.7 to 6.1 m) wide. 17 the first pueblos appeared at mesa verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of mesa verdeans lived in them. as local populations grew, puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. this shift from semi-nomadism to a "sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral pueblo society forever". 18 19 large pueblo i settlements laid claim to the resources found within 15 to 30 square miles (39 to 78 km 2 km) apart. by 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in mesa verde. 20 m 2 pueblo ii era great houses chaco canyon 21 san juan river 22 21 pueblo ii: 900 to 1150 edit main article:  pueblo ii period the pueblo ii period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of chaco canyon. despite their participation in the vast chacoan system, mesa verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century mesa verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of chacoan great house construction. 22 23 22 mesa verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the pueblo ii era. during the 11th century, they built  check dams 24 m) across. these mesa verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a  sipapu 17 jacal 25 the expansion of chacoan influence in the mesa verde area left its most visible mark in the form of chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many mesa verdean villages after 1075. 22 26 27 aztec 22 b 29 pueblo iii: 1150 to 1300 edit main article:  pueblo iii period 30 a severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the san juan basin, particularly at chaco canyon. as the extensive chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to mesa verde, causing major population growth in the area. this led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for mesa verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. in order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the mesa verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure. 31 the chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to mesa verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and mesa verde became isolated from the surrounding region. 32 33 mesa verdean villages thrived during the mid-pueblo iii era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. structures built during this period have been described as "among the world\'s greatest archaeological treasures". 34 35 36 28 yellow jacket pueblo 37 38 33 the 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the mesa verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures.  dendrochronology 39 ceramic 40 23 41 c. 1285 42 warfare edit during the pueblo iii period (1150 to 1300), mesa verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. they often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas. 43 44 28 45 46 evidence of violence and  cannibalism 47 c canyons of the ancients national monument 28 crow canyon archaeological center c. 1280 48 scalped 49 50 migration edit the mesa verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. this might have driven emigration to mesa verde from less hospitable locations. the added population stressed the mesa\'s environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought. 51 41 28 52 53 54 55 d the vacating mesa verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. an estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited. 58 e 59 rio chama pajarito plateau 60 little colorado river 61 bison 62 acomo zuni jemez laguna 57 f organization edit although chaco canyon might have exerted regional control over mesa verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archeologists view the mesa verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure. 64 m) wide and lined with earthen  berms great north road 65 ancestral puebloan shrines, called  herraduras 66 g architecture edit cyark national park service kivas mesa verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the  canyon sandstone adobe 67 pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in  u, e l 68 69 70 while much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and  pit-houses 38 astronomy edit mesa verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. several great houses in the region were aligned to the  cardinal directions 71 the temple is d-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. 72 73 lunar standstill winter solstice 74 h agriculture and water-control systems edit starting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central mesa verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. the combination of corn and beans provided the mesa verdeans with the amino acids of a  complete protein ha) of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. as mesa verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. the mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. 76 legumes 77 the most mesa verdeans practiced  dry farming seeps 78 79 between 750 and 800, mesa verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms m) across and constructed on the mesa top. the reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately 6 miles (9.7 km), which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. in 2004, the  american society of civil engineers national civil engineering historic landmarks 80 81 hunting and foraging edit mesa verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. their main sources of animal protein came from  mule deer 82 83 awls 82 mesa verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. depending on the season, they collected pion nuts and

sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feastsized vessels were produced. 91 92 93 94 89 93 rock art and murals edit 95 rock art is found throughout the mesa verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. styles also vary over time. examples are relatively rare on mesa verde proper, but abundant in the middle san juan river area, which might indicate the river\'s importance as a travel route and key source of water. common  motifs 96 97 petroglyphs 95 starting during the late pueblo ii period (1020) and continuing through pueblo iii (1300), the ancestral puebloans of the mesa verde region created plaster  murals c. 500 98 anthropogenic ecology, geography, and climate edit anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. 82 99 pack rat tumbleweed clover 100 mesa verde\'s canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area. this resulted in mesa verde national park elevations ranging from about 6,000 to 8,572 feet (1,829 to 2,613 m), the highest elevation at park point. the terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the  rocky mountains 68 the region\'s precipitation pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. 41 m), the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees cooler than the mesa top, which reduced the amount of water needed for farming. 101 102 geology edit although the area\'s first spanish explorers named the feature  mesa verde cuesta 103 in the late cretaceous period, the  mancos shale dakota sandstone point lookout sandstone 104 next is the menefee formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. these were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the menefee formation. at the top, this formation is intruded upon by the cliff house sandstone. 104 the cliff house sandstone is the area\'s youngest rock layer. it was formed after the cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. like the point lookout sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. it contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. the shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the ancestral puebloans constructed their dwellings. 104 continuing through the cretaceous period and into the early  tertiary la plata mountains 104 rediscovery edit mexican-spanish missionaries and explorers  francisco atanasio domnguez and silvestre vlez de escalante santa fe green plateau plateaus 105 106 colorado plateau 107 the mesa verde region has long been occupied by the utes, and an 1868 treaty between them and the united states government recognized ute ownership of all colorado land west of the continental divide. after there had become an interest in land in western colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the ute with a strip of land in southwestern colorado between the border with new mexico and 15 miles north. most of mesa verde lies within this strip of land. the ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of mesa verde. believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings. 105 occasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, john moss, making his observations known in 1873. 108 william henry jackson 108 william h. holmes 108 hayden survey 108 in her quest to find ancestral puebloan settlements, virginia mcclurg, a journalist for the  new york daily graphic 68

site in the mesa verde region to gain federal protection. it was the first such site to be protected in the us. 34 115 118 109 119 c. 1910 by the end of the 19th century, it was clear that mesa verde needed protection from people in general who came to mesa verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts. in a report to the  secretary of the interior smithsonian institution jesse walter fewkes parties of "curio seekers" camped on the ruin for several winters, and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals. some of these objects are now in museums, but many are forever lost to science. in order to secure this valuable archeological material, walls were broken down 120 many artifacts from mesa verde are now located in museums and private collections in the usa and across the world. a representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, is now in the  british museum 121 theodore

(2002), and the balcony house complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. the chapin v and pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the long mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum 135 prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but

verde boasts a number of mesa-top ruins. 139 140 balcony house edit balcony house is set on a high ledge facing east. its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel. the exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure. one log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the mesa verde people migrated out of the area. 141 142 143 144 cliff palace edit main article:  cliff palace this multi-storied ruin, the best-known cliff dwelling in mesa verde, is located in the largest alcove in the center of the great mesa. it was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. 145 146 147 30 long house edit located on the wetherill mesa, long house is the second-largest mesa verdean village; approximately 150 people lived there. the location was excavated from 1959 through 1961, as part of the wetherhill mesa archeological project. 148 c. 1200 149 150 mug, oak tree, spruce tree, and square tower houses edit mug house is located on wetherill mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large

corn was introduced to the great sage plain, the regions north and west of mesa verde, from mexico. 8 donna glowacki refutes this position, suggesting that the people of aztec never achieved the wide-spread influence of chaco canyon. she believes the relationship between mesa verde and aztec was more likely one of competition and conflict, versus religious or social hegemony. 28 the earliest known evidence for large-scale violence in the region was uncovered in southeastern utah. future mesa verde rediscoverer,  richard wetherill hyde exploring expedition 48 when the spanish first settled in the area in 1598, they proposed that the utes and navajo had driven the ancestral puebloans away from mesa verde. 56 57 contemporary native americans do not describe the region as abandoned, but rather view it as a stage in the area\'s ongoing indigenous culture. 57 during this time, the entirety of the zuni people are believed to have migrated to western new mexico. archeological evidence suggests that another large group of mesa verdeans migrated approximately 200 miles (320 km) to southwestern new mexico, where they built structures that are now known as pinnacle ruin. 63 similar structures are used by modern pueblo people. 66 painted wavy lines in the square tower at cliff palace average 18.6 marks each, suggesting that people recorded four of these events there. 75 72 mancos shale was the most commonly used clay in the region, particularly for non-decorated grey wares. 86 citations march 7, charles 2006 910: paleo-indians;  lekson 2015 105: southeastern utah to

km) to the northwest. it is believed that the pinnacles came from this particular volcano due to the unique  breccias 43 andesite rhyolite fault block 44 large-scale earth movement also created the  talus shear fractures 43 since the pinnacles were moved to this area, the san andreas fault has shifted 4 miles (6.4 km) to the east of the park. the original location of the san andreas can be seen in the chalone creek fault. two other large faults are known to run through the park, the miner\'s gulch and pinnacles faults. these faults parallel the san andreas and were most likely caused by major movements of the main fault. 43 plate tectonics 44 seismic united states geological survey seismometers 43 ecology edit resolution adjustable pdf map animals edit prairie falcons california

grizzly black bears 49 like many parks in central california, pinnacles has had a small problem with wild  pigs domestic pigs wild boars national park service km) around the center core of the park. outside this fence, however, wild pigs still roam in regular abundance. current monitoring for potential breaks and breaches in the fence is needed to ensure that the pigs do not return to devastate the park. 50 thirteen species of bats have been documented at pinnacles, with a further three species considered likely. the park\'s talus caves provide roosting and breeding habitat for the bats. 51 in the 1990s a student biologist, olivia messinger, did a census of bees at pinnacles. she found that the park has more bees per unit area than we know of, anywhere else on earth, around 400 species. most of these bees are solitary bees, not living in colonies like european honeybees, and most live for only three to four weeks. and since flowers bloom here throughout the growing season, there are many niches for all the bee species. an interesting five-minute video is found at sfnps.org/bees  52 vegetation edit in the warmer portions of the park, large areas of  greasewood manzanita gray pine canyon live oak blue oak california buckeye hollyleaf cherry coffeeberry elderberries 53 hain wilderness edit more than 80% (15,985 acres or 6,469 hectares) of the park is designated as the hain wilderness (known until 2013 as the pinnacles wilderness). wilderness designation provides even higher protection for the rock spires that give pinnacles its name, as well as south chalone peak, the second highest peak in the park. the wilderness includes the creeks and canyons that are habitat for the endangered  red-legged frog 54 united states congress public law national wilderness preservation system 55 activities edit although roads approach the park from the west through soledad and from the east through empty lands south of hollister, the roads do not connect in the park. most of the developed areas are on the east side of the park. 56 there are several trails for day hikers, some of which are strenuous. primarily in march and april, a wide variety of wildflowers is on display, except in years of extreme drought. the trails provide views of the surrounding hills and valleys on clear days. the san andreas fault is visible from some vantages along the trails. the park includes a well known hiking portion known among enthusiasts simply as "the pig fence". this portion of south wilderness trail is a challenging stretch of strenuous hiking that at times requires use of the fence, erected to prevent feral pigs from entering the park, to help oneself to climb the steeply pitched trail. other trails include lush wildflower accented views along flat stream beds, trails that bring one into beautiful caves, and trails that involve high vistas of the pinnacle formations. the park is popular with advanced rock climbers due to the many difficult and challenging climbs. 57 the caves at pinnacles are  talus caves 58 townsend\'s big-eared bat 59 camping facilities are available on the east side in the pinnacles campground. 60 see also edit state route 25 state

miles (80 km) from it. in this temperate but humid coastal zone, the trees receive moisture from both heavy winter rains and persistent summer fog. the presence and consistency of the summer fog is actually more important to overall health of the trees than heavy precipitation. this fact is born out in annual precipitation totals, which range between 25 and 122 inches (64 and 310 cm) annually, with healthy redwood forests throughout the areas of less precipitation because excessive needs for water are mitigated by the ever-present summer fog and the cooler temperatures it ensures. snow is

being a park, much of the area was farmland and there are still remnants of old farms in several places. the commonwealth of virginia slowly acquired the land through  eminent domain 10 in the creation of the park [the skyline drive right-of-way was purchased from owners without condemnation], a number of families and entire communities were required to vacate portions of the  blue ridge mountains madison county page county rappahannock county nearly 90% of the inhabitants worked the land for a living. many worked in the apple orchards in the valley and in areas near the eastern slopes. the work to create the national park and skyline drive began following a terrible drought in 1930 which destroyed the crops of many families in the area who farmed in the mountainous terrain, as well as many of the apple orchards where they worked picking crops. nevertheless, it remains a fact that they were displaced, often against their will, and even for a very few who managed to stay, their communities were lost. a little-known fact is that, while some families were removed by force, a few others (who mostly had also become difficult to deal with) were allowed to stay after their properties were acquired, living in the park until nature took its course and they gradually died. the policy allowed the elderly and disabled who so wished to remain with life tenancy. the last to die was annie lee bradley shenk who died in 1979 at age 92. most of the people displaced left their homes quietly. according to the  virginia historical society 10 skyline drive a view from  skyline
