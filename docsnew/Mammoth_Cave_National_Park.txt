sandstone epikarstic zone caprock human-explorable caves the limestone layers of the  stratigraphic girkin formation ste. genevieve limestone st. louis limestone the bottomless pit in mammoth cave each of the primary layers of limestone is divided further into named geological units and subunits. one area of cave research involves correlating the stratigraphy with the cave survey produced by explorers. this makes it possible to produce approximate three-dimensional maps of the contours of the various layer boundaries without the necessity for test wells and extracting core samples. the upper sandstone caprock is relatively hard for water to penetrate: the exceptions are where vertical cracks occur. this protective role means that many of the older, upper passages of the cave system are very dry, with no  stalactites stalagmites however, the sandstone caprock layer has been dissolved and eroded at many locations within the park, such as the frozen niagara room. the "contact" between limestone and sandstone can be found by hiking from the valley bottoms to the ridgetops: typically, as one approaches the top of a ridge, one sees the outcrops of exposed rock change in composition from limestone to sandstone at a well-defined elevation. 6 at one valley bottom in the southern region of the park, a massive  sinkhole cedar sink mammoth cave is home to the  endangered

the tour was discontinued for logistic and environmental reasons in the early 1990s. 7 mammoth cave headquarters and visitor's center is located on  mammoth cave parkway kentucky route 70 kentucky route 255 8 history edit prehistory edit world heritage site the story of human beings in relation to mammoth cave spans six thousand years. several sets of  native american mummies an exception to purposeful burial was discovered when in 1935 the remains of an adult male were discovered under a large boulder. the boulder had shifted and settled onto the victim, a pre-columbian miner, who had disturbed the rubble supporting it. the remains of the ancient victim were named "lost john" and exhibited to the public into the 1970s, when they were interred in a secret location in mammoth cave for reasons of preservation as well as emerging political sensitivities with respect to the public display of native american remains. research beginning in the late 1950s led by  patty jo watson washington university st. louis, missouri archaic woodland peoples carbon dates hunter-gatherer plant domestication agriculture another technique employed in  archaeological research experimental archaeology ancient human remains and artifacts within the caves are protected by various federal and state laws. one of the most basic facts to be determined about a newly discovered artifact is its precise location and situation. even slightly moving a prehistoric artifact contaminates it from a research perspective. explorers are properly trained not to disturb archaeological evidence, and some areas of the cave remain out-of-bounds for even seasoned explorers, unless the subject of the trip is archaeological research on that area. besides the remains that have been discovered in the portion of the cave accessible through the historic entrance of mammoth cave, the remains of cane torches used by native americans, as well as other artifacts such as drawings, gourd fragments, and woven grass moccasin slippers are found in the salts cave section of the system in flint ridge. though there is undeniable proof of their existence and use of the cave, there is no evidence of further use past the archaic period. experts and scientists have no answer as to why this is, making it one of the greatest mysteries of mammoth cave to this day. earliest known history edit the 31,000-acre (13,000 ha) tract known as the "pollard survey" was sold by  indenture 10, 1791 in  philadelphia ha) of the "pollard survey" between the north bank of  bacon creek green river thomas lang, jr. yorkshire 3, 1796, for 4,116/13s/0d (4,116.65). the land was lost to a local county tax claim during the  war of 1812 legend has it that the first european to discover mammoth cave was either john houchin or his brother francis houchin, in 1797. while hunting, houchin pursued a wounded bear to the cave's large entrance opening near the green river. some houchin family tales have john decatur "johnny dick" houchin as the discoverer of the cave, but this is highly unlikely because johnny dick was only 10 years old in 1797 and was unlikely to be out hunting bears at such a tender age. his father john is the more likely candidate from that branch of the family tree, but the most probable candidate for discoverer of mammoth cave is francis "frank" houchin whose land was much closer to the cave entrance than his brother john's. there is also the argument that their brother charles houchin, who was known as a great hunter and trapper, was the man who shot that bear and chased it into the cave. the shadow over charles's claim is the fact that he was residing in illinois until 1801. contrary to this story is brucker and watson's  the longest cave the land containing this historic entrance was first surveyed and registered in 1798 under the name of valentine simons. simons began exploiting mammoth cave for its  saltpeter according to family records passed down through the houchin, and later henderson families, john houchin was bear hunting and the bear turned and began to chase him. he found the cave entrance when he ran into the cave for protection from the charging bear. 19th century edit in partnership with valentine simon, various other individuals would own the land through the  war of 1812 british in july 1812, the cave was purchased from simon and other owners by charles wilkins and an investor from philadelphia named hyman gratz. soon the cave was being mined for  calcium nitrate a half-interest in the cave changed hands for ten thousand dollars (a huge sum at the time). after the war when prices fell, the workings were abandoned and it became a minor tourist attraction centering on a  native american mummy when wilkins died his estate's executors sold his interest in the cave to gratz. in the spring of 1838, the cave was sold by the gratz brothers to franklin gorin, who intended to operate mammoth cave purely as a tourist attraction, the bottom long having since fallen out of the saltpeter market. gorin was a slave owner, and used his slaves as tour guides. one of these slaves would make a number of important contributions to human knowledge of the cave, and become one of mammoth cave's most celebrated historical figures. stephen bishop african-american slave maps stephen bishop was introduced to mammoth cave in 1838 by franklin gorin. gorin wrote, after bishop's death: "i placed a guide in the cave the celebrated and great stephen, and he aided in making the discoveries. he was the first person who ever crossed the bottomless pit, and he, myself and another person whose name i have forgotten were the only persons ever at the bottom of gorin's dome to my knowledge. 9 in 1839,  john croghan louisville tuberculosis throughout the 19th century, the fame of mammoth cave would grow so that the cave became an international sensation. at the same time, the cave attracted the attention of 19th century writers such as  robert montgomery bird nathaniel parker willis bayard taylor john muir 10 edwin booth john wilkes booth assassinated abraham lincoln jenny lind 5, 1851), and violinist  ole bull by 1859, when the  louisville and nashville railroad park city mammoth cave railroad early 20th century: the kentucky cave wars edit the difficulties of farming life in the hardscrabble, poor soil of the cave country influenced local owners of smaller nearby caves to see opportunities for commercial exploitation, particularly given the success of mammoth cave as a tourist attraction. the "kentucky cave wars" were a period of bitter competition between local cave owners for tourist money. broad tactics of deception were used to lure visitors away from their intended destination to other private show caves. misleading signs were placed along the roads leading to the mammoth cave. a typical strategy during the early days of automobile travel involved representatives (known as "cappers") of other private show caves hopping aboard a tourist's car's running board, and leading the passengers to believe that mammoth cave was closed, quarantined, caved in or otherwise inaccessible. in 1906, mammoth cave became accessible by  steamboat brownsville, kentucky in 1909,  max kmper the croghan family suppressed the topographic element of kmper's map, and it is not known to survive today, although the cave map portion of kmper's work stands as a triumph of accurate cave cartography: not until the early 1960s and the advent of the modern exploration period would these passages be surveyed and mapped with greater accuracy. kmper returned to berlin, and from the point of view of the mammoth cave country, disappeared entirely. it was not until the turn of the 21st century that a group of german tourists, after visiting the cave, researched kmper's family and determined his fate: the young kmper was killed in  trench warfare battle of the somme famed french cave explorer  douard-alfred martel 11 in the early 1920s, george morrison created, via blasting, a number of entrances to mammoth cave on land not owned by the croghan estate. absent the data from the croghan's secretive surveys, performed by kmper, bishop, and others, which had not been published in a form suitable for determining the geographic extent of the cave, it was now conclusively shown that the croghans had been for years exhibiting portions of mammoth cave which were not under land they owned. lawsuits were filed and, for a time, different entrances to the cave were operated in direct competition with each other. in the early 20th century,  floyd collins 12 media sensation the national park movement (19261941) edit as the last of the croghan heirs died, advocacy momentum grew among wealthy citizens of kentucky for the establishment of mammoth cave national park. private citizens formed the mammoth cave national park association in 1926. the park was authorized may 25, 1926. 13 donated funds were used to purchase some farmsteads in the region, while other tracts within the proposed national park boundary were acquired by right of  eminent domain 14 for legal reasons, the federal government was prohibited from restoring or developing the cleared farmsteads while the private association held the land: this regulation was evaded by the operation of "a maximum of four"  ccc 22, 1933 to july 1942. 15 16 according to the national park service, "by may 22, 1936, 27,402 acres of land had been acquired and accepted by the secretary of the interior. the area was declared a national park on july 1, 1941 when the minimum of 45,310 acres (over 600 parcels) had been assembled." 17 superintendent hoskins later wrote of a  summer tanager 20, starting in 1938. the bird ate from food held in the hands of the guides, to the delight of visitors, and provided food to his less-tame mate. 18 birth of the national park (1941) edit mammoth cave national park was officially dedicated on july 1, 1941. by coincidence, the same year saw the incorporation of the  national speleological society the new entrance, closed to visitors since 1941, was reopened on december 26, 1951, becoming the entrance used for the beginning of the frozen niagara tour. 19 the longest cave (19541972) edit by 1954, mammoth cave national park's land holdings encompassed all lands within its outer boundary with the exception of two privately held tracts. one of these, the old lee collins farm, had been sold to harry thomas of horse cave, kentucky, whose grandson, william "bill" austin, operated collins crystal cave as a show cave in direct competition with the national park, which was forced to maintain roads leading to the property. condemnation and purchase of the crystal cave property seemed only a matter of time. in february 1954, a two-week expedition under the auspices of the  national speleological society 20 the c-3 expedition drew public interest, first from a photo essay published by robert halmi in the july 1954 issue of true magazine and later from the publication of a double first-person account of the expedition,  the caves beyond: the story of the collins crystal cave expedition roger brucker 21 in 1955 crystal cave was connected by survey with unknown cave, the first connection in the flint ridge system. some of the participants in the c-3 expedition wished to continue their explorations past the conclusion of the c-3 expedition, and organized as the flint ridge reconnaissance under the guidance of austin, jim dyer, john j. lehrberger and e. robert pohl. this organization was incorporated in 1957 as the  cave research foundation patty jo watson prehistory in march 1961, the crystal cave property was sold to the national park service for $285,000. 22 great onyx cave inholding colossal cave was connected by survey to salts cave in 1960 and in 1961 colossal-salts cave was similarly connected to crystal-unknown cave, creating a single cave system under much of flint ridge. by 1972, the flint ridge cave system had been surveyed to a length of 86.5 miles (139.2 km), making it the longest cave in the world. flintmammoth connection (1972) edit during the 1960s, cave research foundation (crf) exploration and mapping teams had found passageways in the flint ridge cave system that penetrated under houchins valley and came within 800 feet of known passages in mammoth cave. in 1972, crf chief cartographer john wilcox pursued an aggressive program to finally connect the caves, fielding several expeditions from the flint ridge side as well as exploring leads in mammoth cave. on a july 1972 trip deep in the flint ridge cave system,  patricia crowther with her slight frame of 115  pounds kg)crawled through a narrow canyon later dubbed the "tight spot", which acted as a filter for larger cavers. a subsequent trip past the tight spot on august 30, 1972 by wilcox, crowther, richard zopf, and tom brucker discovered the name "pete h" inscribed on the wall of a river passage with an arrow pointing in the direction of mammoth cave. 23 world war ii finally, on september 9, 1972, a six-person crf team of wilcox, crowther, zopf, gary eller, stephen wells, and cleveland pinnix (a national park service ranger) followed hanson's lost river downstream to discover its connection with echo river in cascade hall of mammoth cave. with this linking of the flint ridge and mammoth cave systems, the "everest of speleology" had been climbed. the integrated cave system contained 144.4 miles (232.4 km) of surveyed passages and had fourteen entrances. 24 recent discoveries edit further connections between mammoth cave and smaller caves or cave systems have followed, notably to proctor/morrison cave beneath nearby joppa ridge in 1979. proctor cave was discovered by jonathan doyle, a union army deserter during the civil war, and was later owned by the mammoth cave railroad, before being explored by the crf. morrison cave was discovered by george morrison in the 1920s. this connection pushed the frontier of mammoth exploration southeastward. at the same time, discoveries made outside the park by an independent group called the central kentucky karst coalition or ckkc resulted in the survey of tens of miles in roppel cave east of the park. discovered in 1976, roppel cave was briefly on the list of the nation's longest caves before it was connected to the proctor/morrison's section of the mammoth cave system on september 10, 1983. the connection was made by two mixed parties of crf and ckkc explorers. each party entered through a separate entrance and met in the middle before continuing in the same direction to exit at the opposite entrance. the resulting total surveyed length was near 300 miles (480 km). on march 19, 2005, a connection into the roppel cave portion of the system was surveyed from a small cave under eudora ridge, adding approximately three miles to the known length of the mammoth cave system. the newly found entrance to the cave, now termed the "hoover entrance," had been discovered in september, 2003, by alan canon and james wells. 25 km). 3 5 it is certain that many more miles of cave passages await discovery in the region. discovery of new natural entrances is a rare event: the primary mode of discovery involves the pursuit of side passages identified during routine systematic exploration of cave passages entered from known entrances. related and nearby caves edit at least two other massive cave systems lie short distances from mammoth cave: the  fisher ridge

inhabit the caverns:  indiana bat myotis sodalis gray bat myotis grisescens little brown bat myotis lucifugus big brown bat eptesicus fuscus eastern pipistrelle pipistrellus subflavus all together, these and more rare bat species such as the  eastern small-footed bat lasiurus borealis other animals which inhabit the caves include: two genera of crickets ( hadenoecus subterraneus ceuthophilus stygius ceuthophilus latens cave salamander eurycea lucifuga cave fish typhlichthys subterraneus amblyopsis spelaea cave crayfish orconectes pellucidus cave shrimp palaemonias ganteri in addition, some surface animals may take refuge in the entrances of the caves but do not generally venture into the deep portions of the cavern system. misconceptions related to the mammoth cave system's name
