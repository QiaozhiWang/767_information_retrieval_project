than 11,000 years before the present, with documented sites just outside park boundaries dated to more than 8,000 years before present. however, relatively few archaeological sites have been documented within the park boundaries, owing to the region's high elevation, with harsh winter conditions and scarce resources compared to lower elevations in the area. the oldest site within park boundaries is the teklanika river site, dated to about 7130 bp. more than 84 archaeological sites have been documented within the park. the sites are typically characterized as hunting camps rather than settlements, and provide little cultural context. the presence of  athabaskan koyukon tanana dena'ina 3 polychrome mountains establishment of the park edit in 1906, conservationist  charles

feet (5,500 m) is the highest of any mountain in the world. the mountain is still gaining about 1 millimetre (0.039 in) in height each year due to the continued convergence of the  north american pacific plates granite there are three major rock provinces that run in east-west bands through the park. the oldest is in the north, and the younger ones in the south. citation needed terranes the oldest rocks in the park are part of the yukon-tanana terrane. they originated from ocean sediments deposited between 400 million and 1 billion years ago. the original rocks have been affected by the processes of regional metamorphism, folding, and faulting to form rocks such as  schist quartzite phyllite slate marble limestone the next oldest group of rocks is the farewell terrane. it is composed of rocks from the  paleozoic era the pingston, mckinley, and chulitna terranes are the next oldest; they were deposited in the  mesozoic era marble chert limestone shale sandstone igneous gabbro diabase diorite pillow basalts some of the youngest rocks in the park include the kahlitna terrane, which is a flysch sequence (a sedimentary rock sequence deposited in a marine environment during the early stages of mountain building) formed about 100 million years ago, during late  cretaceous basalt rhyolite 14 denali national park and preserve is located in an area of intense tectonic activity:

semicircular basins called  cirques arte col horn glaciers deposit rock fragments, but the most notable of the depositions are the erratics, which are large rock fragments carried some distance from the source, found on glacial terraces and ridge tops in many places throughout denali. headquarter erratics are made of granite and can be the size of a house. some erratics (like those from the yanert valley) are located 30 miles (48 km) away from their original location. ruth glacier large amounts of rock debris are carried on, in, and beneath the ice as the glaciers move downslope. lateral moraines are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride along the edge of the moving glaciers. when  lateral moraines medial moraines braided meltwater streams heavily loaded with rock debris continually shift and intertwine their channels over valley floors. valley trains are built up as streams drop quantities of poorly sorted sediment. valley trains are long, narrow accumulation of glacial outwash, confined by valley walls. kettles kettle lakes citation needed kantishna km) long and 280 feet (85 m) deep. permafrost edit during the very cold  pleistocene permafrost mm) to 10 feet (3.0 m) thick. the permafrost layer below the active layer has been measured to be between 30 and 100 feet (9.1 and 30.5 m) deep depending on the location of measurement in the park. a stand of white spruce growing on a lower slope of denali is called the  drunken forest shallow ponds in denali are known as thaw lakes and cave-in lakes. they form where sunwarmed water has melted basins in the underlying permafrost. they deepen gradually in the summer months depending on the temperature variance. if the temperature is high enough, the thaw lakes and cave-in lakes will enlarge as their rims collapse. ice has 10 percent greater volume than water, so it continues to exert pressure on the ground. thermal expansion and contraction can cause cracks to develop in the permafrost. during the thaw season in the freeze-thaw cycle, water gets into the cracks and forms veins of ice called ice wedges. ice wedges enlarge with successive seasons of freezing and thawing. some ice wedges that have been buried for centuries are revealed during excavations or landslides. 14 climate edit long winters are followed by short growing seasons. eighty percent of the bird population returns after cold months, raising their young. most mammals and other wildlife in the park spend the brief summer months preparing for winter and raising their young. summers are usually cool and damp, but temperatures in the 70s are not rare. the weather is so unpredictable that there have even been instances of snow in august. the north and south side of the alaskan range have a completely different climate. the  gulf of alaska climate data for denali national park month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec year average high f (c) 9.3 13.9 25.8 40.6 56.2 67.8 69.0
