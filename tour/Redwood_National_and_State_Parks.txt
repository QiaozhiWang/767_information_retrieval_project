companies have replanted much of the logged area with non-native tree species. coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, partly due to the suppression of  forest fires controlled burning 19 the park has transformed a few logging roads into scenic public drives. these do not meet current safety standards, but funding to improve them is not available

support tree-sized trunks growing on them. this typically occurs above 150 feet (46 m). scientists have recently discovered that plants which normally grow on the forest floor also grow in these

miles (80 km) from it. in this temperate but humid coastal zone, the trees receive moisture from both heavy winter rains and persistent summer fog. the presence and consistency of the summer fog is actually more important to overall health of the trees than heavy precipitation. this fact is born out in annual precipitation totals, which range between 25 and 122 inches (64 and 310 cm) annually, with healthy redwood forests throughout the areas of less precipitation because excessive needs for water are mitigated by the ever-present summer fog and the cooler temperatures it ensures. snow is uncommon even on peaks above 1,500 feet (460 m), further exemplifying the mild, temperate nature of this northern latitude; 38 fire management edit wildfires 39 prescribed fire exotic species
