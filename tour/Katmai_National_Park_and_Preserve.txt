pyroclastic flow following its designation, the monument was left undeveloped and largely unvisited until the 1950s. initially designated because of its violent volcanic history, the monument and surrounding lands became appreciated for their abundance of sockeye salmon, the grizzly bears that fed upon them, and a wide variety of other alaskan wildlife and marine life. after a series of boundary expansions, the present national park and preserve were established in 1980 under the  alaska national interest lands conservation act contents 1 geography 1.1 volcanoes 2 activities 3

is prohibited. 418,548 acres (169,380 ha) are preserve lands, where both sport and subsistence hunting are permitted. the most commonly hunted species in the preserve include grizzly bear, which has led to some problems about bear hunting due to small preserve population sizes and stalking bears to close limits. 5 6 the foundation rocks on the alaska peninsula are divided by the bruin bay fault into fossiliferous sedimentary rocks of jurassic and cretaceous age to the east and metamorphic and igneous rocks to the west. the granite aleutian range  batholith moraines peat permafrost 7 two physiographic provinces cover the park. the aleutian range province is composed of the shelikof strait coastline, about 10 miles (16 km) deep along the coast, the aleutian mountain zone, and the lake, or hudsonian zone. farther west the nushagak-bristol bay lowlands province is separated from the aleutian zone by the bruin bay fault, occupying a small corner of the park. 8 volcanoes edit the active volcanoes in the park are  mount katmai novarupta trident volcano mount mageik mount martin fourpeaked mountain mount douglas mount griggs snowy mountain mount denison mount kukak devils desk mount kaguyak 9 7 the most significant volcanic event in historical times was the simultaneous eruption of mount katmai and novarupta in june 1912. novarupta's eruption produced a  pyroclastic flow m) thick. at the same time the summit of katmai collapsed into a caldera. as the valley deposits cooled, they emitted steam from fissures and fumaroles, earning the name " valley of ten thousand smokes m) deep, but only 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3.0 m) wide. 7 stratovolcano m) in height, with a large summit caldera. several glaciers originate from the mountain, and one in the caldera is the only glacier known to have formed in historical times. 7 ft) below the rim. the mountain stands on jurassic sedimentary rocks, and its volcanic components are less than 1,500 feet (460 m) thick. 10 11 plinian ft)

fumaroles and sometimes a crater lake. a large lava flow extends from the mountain to fill the upper part of angle creek's valley with about five cubic kilometers of material. 16 17 m) and three subsidiary vent cones. a small crater hold a lake and fumaroles on the highest cone's flank. 18 19 m) mountain is covered by  fourpeaked glacier 20 21 mount griggs is a 7,602-foot (2,317 m) stratovolcano near novarupta, and somewhat to the northwest of the otherwise straight line of volcanoes in katmai. the flat-topped mountain has three concentric craters, the largest 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) wide. the mountain's geochemistry differs from its neighbors. griggs has active sulfurous fumaroles. 22 m) tall, with ten significant glaciers covering almost all of the mountain. roughly a third to half of the mountain has been eroded by glacial action. the volcano has two vents about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) apart, and active fumaroles at the tallest summit. 23 m) peak with four related vents at the head of three glaciers, 24 8 m) tall. it has a strong fumarole field near the summit. 25 m) high. 26 m), with a 2.5-kilometre (1.6 mi) diameter crater lake. there are two large domes

an unknown number of vents in ice-covered terrain. 29 m) eroded volcanic remnant. 30 activities edit alaska activities at katmai include  hiking backpacking camping backcountry skiing fishing kayaking katmai is also well known for  alaskan brown bears salmon 31 brooks falls 32 hallo bay sedge 33 the vast majority of katmai visitors come to  brooks camp 32 34 35 lodging is available in the park at brooks camp and grosvenor lodge and at several other lodges scattered around the park on inholdings. 36 ecosystems edit weather at katmai is variable, though reliably rainy or drizzly. summer high temperatures average about 63 f (17 c) and winter lows are between 4 and 40 f (20 and 4 c). fall is somewhat drier than the rest of the year, and warm days can occur year round. rainfall is heaviest near the coast, with up to 60 inches (150 cm), and lighter to the west. 37 8 apart from its famous brown bears, katmai also has  snowshoe hares moose red foxes gray wolves beavers canadian lynxes

edit precontact period and archaeology edit prehistoric artifacts have been found dating to about 6,000 years before the present near the old katmai village on the park's south coast. a number of other sites have been found along the coast, notably those of  kaguyak kukak 40 41 amalik bay archeological district inland, brooks camp is a  significant archaeological site national register of historic places national historic landmark old savonoski site dil-161 site alagnak river russians and americans edit russians were the first europeans to arrive in the area in significant numbers, trading in furs. they encountered the aglegmuit eskimos on the bristol bay side of the peninsula and the koniag eskino on the shelikov strait side. katmai village was the only location within the park where europeans lived through the mid-19th century, though their numbers were always few. in the latter part of the 19th century a few villages were established inland at severnosky and along the coast at douglas and kukak. american traders operating for the alaska commercial company took the place of the russians. as sea otters became scarce the trade dried up, and katmai and douglas were abandoned in the early 20th century. in the 1890s the region was a route for travelers going to  nome rex beach the silver horde 8 pyroclastic flow by 1898 there were reports of frequent earthquakes in the vicinity of katmai pass. these intensified around june 1, 1912, inducing the few local residents to leave. katmai and novarupta erupted on june 6 with a noise heard in fairbanks, 500 miles (800 km) away, and juneau, 750 miles (1,210 km) distant. heavy eruptions continued through june 7, then gradually declined from june 8 onwards. ash fell 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) deep in kodiak, and ash fell on the alaskan mainland and eastwards as far as puget sound. atmospheric haze was noted worldwide, and temperatures were depressed in the northern hemisphere during the second half of 1912. initial reports pinpointed mount katmai as the center of eruption. later reports cast doubt on katmai's primary role, and it was not until 1954 that novarupta was found to be the primary volcanic center. the region around the mountains, which had received heavy ashfall, was devastated. 42 the  national geographic society robert fiske griggs national geographic mount mckinley national park horace m. albright gilbert hovey grosvenor national monument antiquities act ha) around mount katmai, the valley, and the iliuk arm on the coast. although only a third the area of the present park and preserve, the monument was nevertheless half the size of  yellowstone national park 42 national monument edit the proclamation had little immediate effect, other than grumbling from territorial officials. a 1923 expedition found that the region had little exploitable mineral potential. tourists in the early 1920s amounted to a few dozen. no park service staff were assigned to the site, which was in theory administered by mount mckinley. by 1928 more visitors arrived. the most prominent among them was father  bernard r. hubbard herbert hoover ha), more than doubling it in size and creating the largest single park service unit. crucially, the expanded monument included the falls at brooks camp, while avoiding lands along the coast thought to have potential oil deposits. 43 in 1937 a ranger was finally assigned to katmai, seconded to the monument from mount mckinley, spending most of june trying to get there and one day in the monument before returning to mount mckinley. in 1939 the  bureau of fisheries alaska fish and game commission km) of the old boundary, signed by president  franklin d. roosevelt 43 poaching increased after world war ii. at the same time, alaskan territorial interests sought to have the monument disestablished or reduced in size to allow mining and fishing, because the activity at the valley of ten thousand smokes had declined, and because the park service had made no effort to develop the monument for visitors. these proposals were turned aside, and in 1950 a seasonal ranger was assigned to katmai. 43 mission 66 1964 alaska earthquake ha)

new park lands, among them a 1,218,490-acre (493,110 ha) expansion of katmai. through the mid-1970s a variety of proposals were circulated for expansion and wilderness designation. at the same time, concerns were raised about the wthdrawal of game lands from sport hunting, and the ability of local residents to continue to practice subsistence hunting. to address these concerns, legislation was proposed to create  national preserve alaska national interest lands conservation act jimmy carter ha) on december 1, 1978, mainly on the northern side of the monument. 44 national park and preserve edit it took two more years for congress to act on a final anilca bill. on december 2, 1980, the final bill established katmai national park and preserve with 1,037,000 acres (420,000 ha) of expanded park and 308,000 acres (125,000 ha) of preserve, with 3,475,000 acres (1,406,000 ha) of wilderness lands within the national park where all hunting is prohibited. 44 47 48 exxon valdez edit the
