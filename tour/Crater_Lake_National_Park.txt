but it is common at higher elevations, especially at crater lake. measurements at park headquarters, 6,475 feet (1,974 m) above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in oregon. winter, which typically begins at the park in september and runs through june, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. up to 37 inches (94 cm) of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), 313 inches (800 cm) in a month (january 1950), and 903 inches (2,290 cm) in a year (1950). 6 snow typically accumulates in the park to depths of 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) by early spring. most of the park's roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. in july and august, snowfall is uncommon, and "one magnificent day typically follows another". 7 january is the coldest month, when highs average about 35 f (2 c) and lows average about 18 f (8 c). 8 f (21 c) and an average low of about 40 f

the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the  pacific ocean f (13 c) on the surface and 38 f (3 c) at the bottom throughout the year. the surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant. climate data for crater lake (19812010 normals) month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec year average high f (c) 34.6

very thick layer of  pumice regolith the pinnacles: when the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed 200-to-300-foot (60 to 90 m) thick gas-charged deposits. for perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through  fumaroles erosion other park features mount scott andesitic lava magma magma

national park is reached by train on the southern pacific railroad lines into medford and klamath falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. a hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. for the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the pacific and dalles-california highways. he will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. the park is open to travel from late june or july 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until october. 15 the lake is described in the poetry of  joaquin miller 16

readily accessible by  automobile km) long and has an elevation gain of 3,800 feet (1,200 m). the highest point in crater lake national park is  mount scott m). getting there requires a fairly steep 2.5-mile (4.0 km) hike from the rim drive trailhead. on a clear day visibility from the summit exceeds 100 miles (160 km), and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. also visible from this point are the white-peaked  cascade range volcanoes columbia river plateau klamath mountains the scenery of crater lake is fully accessible during the summer months. heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular "rim drive", which is generally completely open from july to october, and partially open in some other months, such as may, june, and november. trails edit cleetwood cove edit the cleetwood cove trail is one of the several walk trails that originate from the rim drive. it drops 700 feet (210 m) from the cleetwood cove parking lot. first opened during the summer of 1960 it is the only trail that accesses directly to the lake. 19 wheelchair accessible the watchman edit the watchman trail begins from the watchman overlook parking lot, built in the 1930s. the trail is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long and 700 feet (210 m) vertical. 20 mount mcloughlin mount thielsen union peak mount scott klamath basin 21 lightning spring edit the lightning spring trail starts from the lightning spring picnic area. it is a  3 4 km) hike with an elevation gain of 250 feet (76 m). the trail circles around several meadows up to the lightning spring creek. the trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer. castle crest wildflower garden edit this is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the castle crest wildflower garden. it starts from the east rim road, near the park's headquarters. it received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with  wildflowers 1 2 m) before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart. plaikni falls edit the plaikni falls trail is the newest trail on the crater lake park. it stretches 1.1 miles (1.8 km) from the trailhead located 1.2 miles (1.9 km) south from the phantom ship overlook on pinnacles road, which spins off rim drive. the trail leads to the plaikni falls. most of the trail is wheelchair accessible. the final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging. garfield peak edit phantom ship the  garfield peak km) hike to garfield summit. the trailhead is located east of the crater lake lodge and gains approximately 1,000 feet (300 m) of elevation. several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the phantom ship island and dutton cliff. a few viewpoints offer unique views of wizard island. the trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings. see also edit environment portal oregon portal list of nationally protected areas of the united states national park service rustic national register of historic places listings in
