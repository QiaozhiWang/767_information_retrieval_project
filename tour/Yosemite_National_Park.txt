10 million years ago, vertical movement along the sierra fault started to uplift the sierra nevada. subsequent tilting of the sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the sierra nevada increased the  gradient 63 owens valley basin and range pleistocene exfoliation the uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. 50 talus till numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. they were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion. sculpting by glaciers edit a series of glaciations further modified the region starting about 2 to 3 million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 bp. at least four major glaciations have occurred in the sierra nevada, locally called the sherwin (also called the pre-tahoe), tahoe, tenaya, and tioga. 63 glacial systems reached depths of up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) and left their marks in the yosemite area. the longest glacier in the yosemite area ran down the grand canyon of the tuolumne river for 60 miles (97 km), passing well beyond hetch hetchy valley. merced glacier flowed out of yosemite valley and into the merced river gorge. lee vining glacier
