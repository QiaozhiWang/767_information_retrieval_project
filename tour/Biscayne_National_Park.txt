biscayne bay marks the southernmost extent of the atlantic barrier islands, represented by key biscayne, and the northernmost extent of the florida keys at elliott key. the keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands' surface under a thin veneer of topsoil, while the barrier islands are dominated by wave-deposited sands that cover most of the limestones. 6 oolitic sangamonian interglacial period years ago. the miami formation achieved its present form somewhat later, during a glacial period in which the lagoon deposits were consolidated

agency bay of pigs invasion marcos prez jimnez 36 proposed development edit as modern communities continued growing in and around miami, developers looked to southern dade county for new projects. the undeveloped keys south of key biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. one proposal included building a highway linking the biscayne bay keys to the  overseas highway 37 islandia 38 39 in 1962 an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of biscayne bay, to be known as seadade. seadade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate  daniel k. ludwig m) channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. the channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. 39 florida power and light l) announced plans for two new 400- megawatt 40 many local residents and politicians supported seadade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. they fought against development of the bay and formed the safe progress association. led by lloyd miller, the president of the local chapter of the  izaak walton league miami herald 39 miami herald 41 dante fascell claude r. kirk, jr. herbert hoover, jr. 42 one vision of islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern florida keys km). islandia landowners called it elliott key boulevard, but called it "spite highway" privately. it was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on elliott key now follows the path of elliott key boulevard. 39 the oil-fired turkey point power stations were completed in 196768 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into biscayne bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. 43 l announced plans for two 693 mw nuclear reactors at the site, 44 45 portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park's establishment. homestead bayfront park, still operated by miami-dade county just south of convoy point, established a "blacks-only" segregated beach for african-americans at the present site of the dante fascell visitor center. the segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished. 46 park establishment and history edit the earliest proposals for the protection of biscayne bay were included in proposals by everglades national park advocate  ernest f. coe florida city 5 stewart udall 47 ha) area of elliott key was by this time a part of the dade county park system. 48 49 president lyndon b. johnson signed public law 90-606 to create biscayne national monument on october 18, 1968. the monument was expanded in 1974 under public law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of congress 39 50 51 52 the first islandia property owner to sell land to the  national park service ha) at the age of 70. he visited with park rangers stationed at the former cocolobo club, which eventually burned down in 1975. the other life estate in the park was held by virginia tannehill, the widow of  eastern airlines 53 years. 54 deprived of a rationale for existence by the national monument's establishment, islandia languished. the hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the national park service to the dade county  state attorney's office janet reno 38 47 the impact of hurricane andrew on neighboring  homestead air force base miami international airport mi (3.2 km) to the east,

activities edit biscayne national park operates year-round. camping is most practical in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. private concessioners provide full day tours in the park that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. boat excursions to boca chita and adams key are also available. 61 recreation edit access to the park from the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the dante fascell visitor center at convoy point. all other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. activities include boating, fishing,  kayaking windsurfing snorkeling scuba diving 62 although it is a federally designated park, fishing within biscayne is governed by the state of florida. anglers in biscayne are required to have a florida recreational saltwater fishing license. fishing is limited to designated sport fish,  spiny lobster stone crab blue crab 63 64 a private concessioner provides tours from the park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. most tours are operated during the peak winter season from january to april. 65 personal watercraft 66 67 island facilities edit most of biscayne's permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. a seasonally staffed ranger station is located on elliott key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. a single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the spite highway runs the length of the island. 68 69 70 snorkeling and diving edit snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. the reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. a selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the maritime heritage trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the national park service system. 71 arratoon apcar erl king alicia lugano mandalay alicia erl king lugano 72 mandalay 73 historical structures edit main article:  national

vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. bay salinity reaches a peak in june. 104 red drum florida bay red grouper gray snapper 105

reflects its location in extreme south florida. southern miami-dade county is classified as  tropical savanna kppen-geiger 132 f (19 and 24 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 2.1 inches (53 mm). wet season temperatures average between 76 and 85 f (24 and 29 c) with an average monthly rainfall of 5.39 inches (137 mm). the wet season roughly coincides with  hurricane season 133 like many locations in southern florida, biscayne national park is affected by hurricanes every few years. most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. a direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events. 134 135 1906 florida keys hurricane 28 1926 miami hurricane 1929 bahamas hurricane 1935 labor day hurricane 136 1935 yankee hurricane 1941 florida hurricane 1945 southeast florida hurricane

directly across biscayne national park with maximum sustained winds of 141 miles per hour (227 km/h), with gusts to 169 mph (272 km/h). the storm surge was up to 17 ft (5.2 m) above mean sea level. it was a compact  category 5 139 141 on monday, august 24, 1992, at 4:30 a.m., the eye wall of hurricane andrew passed over this point before striking homestead and southern miami-dade county. 142 the fowey rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of 127 knots (235 km/h) and a gust to 147 knots (272 km/h) before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. the strongest part of the eyewall had not reached fowey rocks when it stopped transmitting. 143 since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. park service studies project that much of the park's land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. 144 cm) by 2030, and 9 to 24 inches (23 to 61 cm) by 2060. 145 cm) is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into the biscayne aquifer. higher rises will make the southern everglades a saltwater marsh, altering the ecology of the region.
