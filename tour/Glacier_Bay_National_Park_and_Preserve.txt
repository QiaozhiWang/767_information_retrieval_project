mild climate with significant rainfall and comparatively low snowfall. lower glacier bay is a transitional zone, and upper glacier bay is cold and snowy. access to the land can be difficult, since the

park are wet tundra, alpine tundra, coastal forest, and glaciers and icefields. 11 wildlife in the area includes both  grizzly black bears coyotes moose sitka black-tailed deer marmots dall sheep

years before the present, with archaeological sites just outside the park dating to that time. evidence of human activity is scarce, because so much of the area is or was glaciated for much of the period and because advancing glaciers may have scoured all traces of historical occupation from their valleys. ongoing uplift of the land may reveal new sites that had been submerged by rising sea levels. most archaeological evidence is from the last 200 years. the  haida eyak tlingit 11 jean-franois de galaup, comte de laprouse lituya bay george vancouver discovery vancouver expedition 11 19
