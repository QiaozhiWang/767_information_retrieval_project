for some glaciers. 50 blackfoot jackson glaciers km 2 km 2 52 53 the impact of glacier retreat on the park's ecosystems is not fully known, but plant and animal species that are dependent on cold water could suffer due to a loss of habitat. reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires. the loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors. 52 climate edit big drift going-to-the-sun road as the park spans the

cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. this approach is common to many other protected areas. as part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant. dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year. 83 km 2 84 km 2 5 recreation edit glacier is distant from major cities.
