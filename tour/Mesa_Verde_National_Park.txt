verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the paleo-indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. they inhabited the outlying areas of the mesa verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and  rock art chert knapping 5 by the late archaic more people were living in semi-permanent rockshelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. they started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. the late archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as  obsidian turquoise abalone c. 1000 6 basketmaker culture edit c. 1 to 500 with the introduction of corn to the mesa verde region  c. 1000 pithouse basketmaker culture basketmaker ii 7 a in addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, basketmaker ii people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. they also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than 5.5 feet (1.7 m) tall. their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. they buried the dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. basketmaker ii people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout mesa verde. they depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. a common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the  hopi kokopelli 9 c. 450 to 750 by 500 ce atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the basketmaker ii era and the beginning of the

era and the beginning of the pueblo i period. the transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. pueblo i people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called  pueblos 16 kivas m) deep and 12 to 20 feet (3.7 to 6.1 m) wide. 17 the first pueblos appeared at mesa verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of mesa verdeans lived in them. as local populations grew, puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. this shift from semi-nomadism to a "sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral pueblo society forever". 18 19 large pueblo i settlements laid claim to the resources found within 15 to 30 square miles (39 to 78 km 2 km) apart. by 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in mesa verde. 20 m 2 pueblo ii era great houses chaco canyon 21 san juan river 22 21 pueblo ii: 900 to 1150 edit main article:  pueblo ii period the pueblo ii period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of chaco canyon. despite their participation in the vast chacoan system, mesa verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century mesa verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of chacoan great house construction. 22 23 22 mesa verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the pueblo ii era. during the 11th century, they built  check dams 24 m) across. these mesa verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a  sipapu 17 jacal 25 the expansion of chacoan influence in the mesa verde area left its most visible mark in the form of chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many mesa verdean villages after 1075. 22 26 27 aztec 22 b 29 pueblo iii: 1150 to 1300 edit main article:  pueblo iii period 30 a severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the san juan basin, particularly at chaco canyon. as the extensive chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to mesa verde, causing major population growth in the area. this led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for mesa verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. in order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the mesa verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure. 31 the chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to mesa verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and mesa verde became isolated from the surrounding region. 32 33 mesa verdean villages thrived during the mid-pueblo iii era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. structures built during this period have been described as "among the world's greatest archaeological treasures". 34 35 36 28 yellow jacket pueblo 37 38 33 the 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the mesa verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures.  dendrochronology 39 ceramic 40 23 41 c. 1285 42 warfare edit during the pueblo iii period (1150 to 1300), mesa verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. they often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas. 43 44 28 45 46 evidence of violence and  cannibalism 47 c canyons of the ancients national monument 28 crow canyon archaeological center c. 1280 48 scalped 49 50 migration edit the mesa verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. this might have driven emigration to mesa verde from less hospitable locations. the added population stressed the mesa's environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought. 51 41 28 52 53 54 55 d the vacating mesa verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. an estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited. 58 e 59 rio chama pajarito plateau 60 little colorado river 61 bison 62 acomo zuni jemez laguna 57 f organization edit although chaco canyon might have exerted regional control over mesa verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archeologists view the mesa verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure. 64 m) wide and lined with earthen  berms great north road 65 ancestral puebloan shrines, called  herraduras 66 g architecture edit cyark national park service kivas mesa verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the  canyon sandstone adobe 67 pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in  u, e l 68 69 70 while much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and  pit-houses 38 astronomy edit mesa verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. several great houses in the region were aligned to the  cardinal directions 71 the temple is d-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. 72 73 lunar standstill winter solstice 74 h agriculture and water-control systems edit starting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central mesa verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. the combination of corn and beans provided the mesa verdeans with the amino acids of a  complete protein ha) of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. as mesa verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. the mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. 76 legumes 77 the most mesa verdeans practiced  dry farming seeps 78 79 between 750 and 800, mesa verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms m) across and constructed on the mesa top. the reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately 6 miles (9.7 km), which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. in 2004, the  american society of civil engineers national civil engineering historic landmarks 80 81 hunting and foraging edit mesa verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. their main sources of animal protein came from  mule deer 82 83 awls 82 mesa verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. depending on the season, they collected pion nuts and

sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feastsized vessels were produced. 91 92 93 94 89 93 rock art and murals edit 95 rock art is found throughout the mesa verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. styles also vary over time. examples are relatively rare on mesa verde proper, but abundant in the middle san juan river area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. common  motifs 96 97 petroglyphs 95 starting during the late pueblo ii period (1020) and continuing through pueblo iii (1300), the ancestral puebloans of the mesa verde region created plaster  murals c. 500 98 anthropogenic ecology, geography, and climate edit anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. 82 99 pack rat tumbleweed clover 100 mesa verde's canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area. this resulted in mesa verde national park elevations ranging from about 6,000 to 8,572 feet (1,829 to 2,613 m), the highest elevation at park point. the terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the  rocky mountains 68 the region's precipitation pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. 41 m), the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees cooler than the mesa top, which reduced the amount of water needed for farming. 101 102 geology edit although the area's first spanish explorers named the feature  mesa verde cuesta 103 in the late cretaceous period, the  mancos shale dakota sandstone point lookout sandstone 104 next is the menefee formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. these were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the menefee formation. at the top, this formation is intruded upon by the cliff house sandstone. 104 the cliff house sandstone is the area's youngest rock layer. it was formed after the cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. like the point lookout sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. it contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. the shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the ancestral puebloans constructed their dwellings. 104 continuing through the cretaceous period and into the early  tertiary la plata mountains 104 rediscovery edit mexican-spanish missionaries and explorers  francisco atanasio domnguez and silvestre vlez de escalante santa fe green plateau plateaus 105 106 colorado plateau 107 the mesa verde region has long been occupied by the utes, and an 1868 treaty between them and the united states government recognized ute ownership of all colorado land west of the continental divide. after there had become an interest in land in western colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the ute with a strip of land in southwestern colorado between the border with new mexico and 15 miles north. most of mesa verde lies within this strip of land. the ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of mesa verde. believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings. 105 occasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, john moss, making his observations known in 1873. 108 william henry jackson 108 william h. holmes 108 hayden survey 108 in her quest to find ancestral puebloan settlements, virginia mcclurg, a journalist for the  new york daily graphic 68

site in the mesa verde region to gain federal protection. it was the first such site to be protected in the us. 34 115 118 109 119 c. 1910 by the end of the 19th century, it was clear that mesa verde needed protection from people in general who came to mesa verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts. in a report to the  secretary of the interior smithsonian institution jesse walter fewkes parties of "curio seekers" camped on the ruin for several winters, and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals. some of these objects are now in museums, but many are forever lost to science. in order to secure this valuable archeological material, walls were broken down 120 many artifacts from mesa verde are now located in museums and private collections in the usa and across the world. a representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, is now in the  british museum 121 theodore

several  wildfires 134 ha) of forest, more than half the park. the fires also damaged many archeological sites and park buildings. they were named: chapin v (1996), bircher and pony (2000), long mesa (2002), and the balcony house complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. the chapin v and pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the long mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum 135 prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the chapin v, bircher and pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed 136 colorado historical society million budget into a  culturally modified trees 137 ute mountain tribal

verde boasts a number of mesa-top ruins. 139 140 balcony house edit balcony house is set on a high ledge facing east. its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel. the exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure. one log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the mesa verde people migrated out of the area. 141 142 143 144 cliff palace edit main article:  cliff palace this multi-storied ruin, the best-known cliff dwelling in mesa verde, is located in the largest alcove in the center of the great mesa. it was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. 145 146 147 30 long house edit located on the wetherill mesa, long house is the second-largest mesa verdean village; approximately 150 people lived there. the location was excavated from 1959 through 1961, as part of the wetherhill mesa archeological project. 148 c. 1200 149 150 mug, oak tree, spruce tree, and square tower houses edit mug house is located on wetherill mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. it received its name from four mugs the charles mason and the wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. 151 152 153 154 153 155 155 156 references edit notes corn was introduced to the great sage plain, the regions north and west of mesa verde, from mexico. 8 donna glowacki refutes this position, suggesting that the people of aztec never achieved the wide-spread influence of chaco canyon. she believes the relationship between mesa verde and aztec was more likely one of competition and conflict, versus religious or social hegemony. 28 the earliest known evidence for large-scale violence in the region was uncovered in southeastern utah. future mesa verde rediscoverer,  richard wetherill hyde exploring expedition 48 when the spanish first settled in the area in 1598, they proposed that the utes and navajo had driven the ancestral puebloans away from mesa verde. 56 57 contemporary native americans do not describe the region as abandoned, but rather view it as a stage in the area's ongoing indigenous culture. 57 during this time, the entirety of the zuni people are believed to have migrated to western new mexico. archeological evidence suggests that another large group of mesa verdeans migrated approximately 200 miles (320 km) to southwestern new mexico, where they built structures that are now known as pinnacle ruin. 63 similar structures are used by modern pueblo people. 66 painted wavy lines in the square tower at cliff palace average 18.6 marks each, suggesting that people recorded four of these events there. 75 72 mancos shale was the most commonly used clay in the region, particularly for non-decorated grey wares. 86 citations march 7, charles 2006 910: paleo-indians;  lekson 2015 105: southeastern utah to
